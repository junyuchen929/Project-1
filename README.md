Data and code for Project 1

About the generalizedDaymetData things:
 - Will create a Daymet folder for you and dump all the downloaded data there
 - Must receive State, County, and Date to caluclate its min, max, and mean.
 - Counties with city counterparts must specify whether they are city or county (e.g. "Baltimore County" and "Baltimore City" but "Baltimore" and "Baltimore (C)" will not work.)
 - Does not redownload if it finds that the file for the county and date already exist in the Daymet Folder
