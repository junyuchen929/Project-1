The rain fell on oversaturated soil, a result of the previous night's rapid snow melt.  During the overnight hours, the remaining water-logged snow pack of 3 to 8 inches was eaten away by strong southeasterly winds which carried low 60s temperatures and near 100 percent relative humidity into the region.Prior to the onset of heavy rain, numerous creeks and streams were near bank full due to the rapid snow melt.  Minor flash flooding began at most locations in the piedmont prior to the squall line; the more serious flooding was associated with the line's passage from west to east, between 0900 and 1130EST.In Orange Co, as in many other counties, schools were closed early due to the continued flood threat.  One school reported damage froma leaking roof.  In Stafford Co, four roads were closed early due to high water.  In Fairfax Co, several automobiles were swept off area roadways inundated by raging creeks and streams.  One of the more prone locations was along state route 7 near the Difficult Run (just south of Great Falls).  Three persons were rescued from stranded vehicles between 1000 and 1200EST.  Two others escaped.  No injuries were reported, but all 5 persons were treated at the scene for hypothermia.  The combination of flooding rains, gusty winds, and lightning knocked out power to around 8000 Virginia Power customers in the Washington, DC suburbs.After the storm and associated cold front passed, gusty northwest winds 35 to 40 mph blew down a few trees rendered unstable by waterlogged soil.  A 100-foot tree fell inn Culpeper Co, near the Rappahannock Co line.  Numerous creeks and streams remained out of their banks well into the evening, even as temperatures plummeted into the upper teens.",NA,PDC

The unseasonably warm air was drawn northward around the circulation of a deepening storm west of the Appalachians late on the 18th and early on the 19th. The melting snow and additional rainfall produced widespread flooding and flash flooding on the 19th.Strong low-level southeast flow developed by late afternoon on the 18th, and pockets of light to moderate rain occurred along the foothills.  Initial flash flooding, in the form of creeks and streams out of their banks and low-lying areas covered in standing water, begain around 0000EST on the 19th.  More widespread flooding ensued between 0100 and 0200EST.A pre-frontal line of heavy showers and embedded thunderstorms moved into the region shortly after dawn on the 19th, causing widespread acute flooding and flash flooding which lasted until around noon.  The line of heavy precipitation moved slowly through the area between 0600 and 0900EST, prolonging the flooding.  Some of the higher totals reported by automated rain gages (which contained some melted snow) were in excess of 5 inches.  Montebello (Nelson Co) received 5.22 inches, Big Meadows (Page Co) had 5.12 inches, Long Run (Rockingham Co) reported 4.47 inches, and Sherando (Augusta Co) had 4.16 inches.One death was reported by Albemarle Co authorities, as a motorist lost control of his vehicle in high water and struck a tree just south of Charlottesville.  High water closed numerous local roads, and several major arteries as well, including federal highway 33 near Harrisonburg (Rockingham Co).  Also in Rockingham Co, authorities evacuated the main street in Broadway when a 20 ton fuel oil tank and two 1000-lb propane tanks broke loose from their moorings and began floating down the street.  In Page Co, 200 residents below the Skyline Lakes Dam were evacuated as the dam threatened to break.

The storm weakened to a depression around this time, moving north of the state by mid-evening.  Torrential rainfall associated with the storm poured onto saturated soil, causing widespread and in many cases catastrophic flooding across the entire western half of Virginia beginning during the pre-dawn hours, which continued until late afternoon.The hardest hit areas were in the Shenandoah Valley, where maximum transport of tropical moisture was lifted over some of the highest terrain in the state to produce incredible rain totals.  In some areas of the Shenandoah Valley, the flood's impact exceeded that of January 1996 and November 1985.  Massive public and private property damage was sustained in Warren, Page, Shenandoah, Rockingham, and Augusta Counties.  In general, storm total rainfall in these areas ranged from 5 to 8 inches at lower elevations, with 9 to 12 inches along the highest peaks of the Shenandoah National Park.  Notable totals at high elevations included 15.61 inches and 14.30 inches at Big Meadows and Toms Branch in Shenandoah National Park.  The storm's heaviest rains fell in a six-hour period at any one location, but rainfall rates ranged from between 1 and 2 inches per hour to as high as 4 inches per hour along the higher terrain.Three persons perished in northwest Virginia as a result of the flooding.  In Highland Co, a woman drowned when she became trapped in an all-terrain vehicle while trying to cross a flooded creek.  Two young males were swept away in Augusta Co north of Staunton when trying to cross a washed-out bridge along the Middle River.  More than 100 persons were rescued from Fran's floodwaters during the event.Numerous school districts closed prior to Fran's arrival.  Such decisions may have saved lives, as local school bus routes through flood-prone areas were either flooded or washed out during the day.  However, not all school systems closed, and some problems did occur.  In western Loudoun Co, a full school bus became stranded, requiring rescue operations.  No injuries were reported.Notable flood-related incidents included:  rooftop rescues in the Shenandoah Valley, including a mother and child in Augusta Co, six persons in Page Co, and 5 more from a third-floor apartment in Rockingham Co; portions of every road were closed in Page and Madison Counties; 40 homes were destroyed and 165 others sustained major damage in Shenadoah Co; fourteen homes and two barns were damaged in Loudoun Co, and 50 basements flooded in Rappahannock Co.Damage was extensive state-wide. Estimates placed property dollar damage at $300 million.  A bumper crop of late summer and early autumn fruits and vegetables was thinned by the storm; farmers in counties around the Shenandoah Valley suffered major losses.  In all, $72 million in agricultural damage was reported across the state; $50 million in crops alone - mainly across the western half of the state.  Across northern Virginia, property damage, including that to rural electric cooperatives, totaled nearly $96 million; agricultural damage totalled $38.4 million.  These values were combined flash flood and river flood damage.",NA,PDC

The unseasonably warm air was drawn northward around the circulation of a deepening storm west of the Appalachians late on the 18th and early on the 19th.  The melting snow and additional rainfall produced widespread flooding and flash flooding on the 19th.Strong low-level southeast flow developed by late afternoon on the 18th.  Initially, colder temperatures in sheltered valleys slowed the rate of snow melt while the warm moist air mass attacked the snow pack at higher elevations.  By mid-evening, however, even the lower elevations were warming rapidly.  Flash flooding began at around the same time as the onset of heavy pre-frontal rains.  Heavier showers fell over the same areas between 0400 and 0800EST, causing acute and widespread flooding and flash flooding.  Some areas received between 2 and 4 inches of rain during this period.  Thunderstorms developed as the line moved into eastern Loudoun Co between 0900 and 0930EST.  Some of the higher totals reported by automated rain gages (including some snow melt) were nearly 5 inches.  Monterey (Highland Co) received 4.71 inches, Front Royal (Frederick Co) had 4.32 inches, Hogback Mountain (Warren Co) reported 3.76 inches, and Woodstock (Shenandoah Co) had 2.43 inches.Some of the most pronounced damage occurred in Shenandoah Co near the town of Woodstock.  One hundred acres of farmland were inundated, a reported 799 homes sustained damage from flood waters, as did a restaurant in Edinburg.

Scattered structural damage included aluminum siding, gutters, shingles, and plastic facia.The tornado began near the fire house, where personnel reported a shed was moved and numerous plastic bags were sucked into the air.  At least one large silver maple tree was damaged.  More serious damage ensued about 1/4 mile east, where the tornado tracked down a hillside.  A large oak split in two, with one of the limbs crashing onto a home on Kenmore St, causing substantial damage.  One electrical wire was blown down.  Much of the shingle, siding, and gutter damage occurred between Lowell St. and the intersection of Shirlington Blvd. and Glebe Road.Damage at the intersection included at least ten trees and large limbs that were snapped, with one shallow-rooted tree uprooted and leaning on a residence.  That same home had two windows blown out.  Two persons at this location witnessed the tornado; the funnel cloud was also seen by the National Airport (DCA) tower, just 3 miles to the east.  The storm continued across Glebe Road, knocking down several large poplar tree limbs.  At a residence on Fillmore St., a home sustained minor damage from a portion of a large pine tree which fell against its side wall and roof.  Several nearby trees and large limbs were also felled.The twister continued into the Army/Navy Country Club golf course, where it knocked down or snapped an estimated 50 to 60 tree limbs, some up to 2 feet in diameter.  Estimated damages at the course were around $50,000.  The funnel lifted moments later.******************************************Tropical moisture feeding along south-moving cold front produced training thunderstorms over portions of the Washington Metropolitan region during the late evening of the 25th.  In general, between 3 and 4 inches of rain fell throughout the event, with at least 2 inches falling just prior to the frontal passage around midnight.  One spotter in Vienna reported a grand total of 4.65 inches of rain.  The rapid accumulation of water swelled area creeks and streams, and closed several roads for a time.

Some of the larger number of road closures included:  Shenandoah Co (32 - a combination of runoff, poor drainage, and some river flooding); Loudoun Co (27); Frederick Co (15);  Orange Co (13); Albemarle Co (12).  Drainage flooding occurred in Waynesboro (Augusta Co) when the combination of slowly melting snow and runoff closed six roads.The storm also produced wind gusts in excess of 30 mph from the eastern Piedmont through the coastal plain.

Isolated heavier showers and thunderstorms developed across the central Shenandoah Valley, first during the overnight hours of the 7th and again during the early and mid afternoon of the 8th, causing several small streams and creeks to overspill their banks.  The rainy period, which lasted the first 12 days of the month, dropped an estimated 3 to 5 inches across all of northern Virginia.A 53 year-old Winchester man was swept to his death as he tried to navigate across a flooded low-water bridge along local route 624, six miles northeast of Front Royal in Warren Co.  The bridge, which spans the main branch of the Shenandoah River below the convergence of the north and south forks, had been closed much of the spring.  Rains of recent days had produced a flow of water 2 feet above the bridge surface; warning signs and cones had been deployed, blocking the entrance to the bridge.Rain gage estimates of 2 to 3 inches produced scattered flooding of small streams and creeks in Madison and Rappahannock Cos.  At least 12 secondary roads were closed in Madison Co by the high waters; at least 3 more were closed in western Rappahannock Co .  The same area of showers and thunderstorms produced lightning, enough to strike a transformer near Charlottesville early on the 8th, causing an estimated 2500 customers to briefly lose power.  Later that day, thunderstorms, dropping between 1 and 2 inches of rain, produced flooding along the Rivanna River, where a festival was being set up.  Damage was minimal.

Heaviest damage was noted in the Charlottesville area, where dozens of trees and large limbs fell, several onto cars and a few onto homes.  Another severe storm, containing estimated winds gusts between 60 and 80 mph, mangled tree branches and split other trees in two in Maurertown along local route 625.  One of the trees fell onto a home, causing minor damage.The storms, which moved rather slowly over saturated ground, induced flash flooding in several counties.

Once again, damage was highlighted by downed trees, large hail, and several cases of flash flooding.  Much of the notable tree damage occurred over and east of the piedmont; flash flooding was seen over and west of the piedmont.The episode was dominated by a single supercell which developed over the west central piedmont near the Blue Ridge and propagated east through Fauquier, Prince William, Fairfax, and Arlington Cos, as well as the independent city of Alexandria.  Earlier cells caused scattered severe weather generally northwest of these areas.The first event of consequence occurred in Woodstock (Shenandoah Co), where a localized storm dumped at least 2 inches of rain in 2 hours - on top of saturated soil - producing flash flooding in portions of town.  Poor drainage and low-lying areas were hard hit, in some instances worse than the flooding in 1996 (associated with tropical storm Fran).  A two-block area was evacuated.  Included in this area was a barbecue catering company, which had some equipment washed out of the store.  A small sport utility vehicle was washed up against a low-water bridge, with water cascading over the vehicle's roof.  Several side streets were flooded, not only in Woodstock but in nearby Toms Brook as well.As the storms tracked east, there were several reports of hail ranging from 0.75"" to 1"" in diameter. Additional flash flooding occurred in Warren Co, where a minor mud slide temporarily closed a portion of Browntown Road.  Low-lying flooding closed the intersection of River and Harrell Road.  Around this time, one thunderstorm cell became dominant as it crossed into Fauquier Co.  Soon after, the storm exhibited a bow-echo feature, and accounts of damaging winds increased accordingly.Large hail, ranging from 0.75"" to 2"" in diameter, fell across portions of Prince William and Fairfax Cos.  Wind gusts knocked trees and large limbs down in Centreville.  Heavier damage occurred as the bow-echo strengthened, in southern Fairfax Co and Alexandria.  In Springfield and Mt Vernon, trees fell on two cars; one motorist was injured (in Springfield) but the other(s) escaped unharmed.  Farther east, at least a dozen trees were felled in Alexandria; large limbs fell on power lines in the south portion of Arlington.  Several more large limbs and/or trees fell alongside or onto the Capital Beltway.  A bit farther south, numerous trees fell along federal highway 1 (west of Wide Water) in extreme northern Stafford Co.A final event occurred in eastern Nelson Co, where several trees fell, including one onto a porch and another onto the roof of the same residence, causing substantial structural damage to the home.In all, 31,000 Virginia Power customers lost power during the storms.

Severe weather, mainly in the form of thunderstorm winds, was confined to Albemarle and Nelson Cos.  Heaviest damage was noted in the Charlottesville area, where dozens of trees and large limbs fell, several onto cars and a few onto homes.  Another severe storm, containing estimated winds gusts between 60 and 80 mph, mangled tree branches and split other trees in two in Maurertown along local route 625.  One of the trees fell onto a home, causing minor damage.The storms, which moved rather slowly over saturated ground, induced flash flooding in several counties.  Rainfall totals, ranging between 2 and 6 inches in the strongest storms, produced street flooding in Charlottesville and Madison.  The town of Elkwood received 6.2 inches of rain which brought area creeks and small streams out of their banks.

Some school buses were unable to reach students in rural areas.  In Clarke Co, at least 20 secondary roads were closed, and federal highway 50 was down to 1 lane at the base of Paris Mountain.  Gravel runoff from secondary roads caused minor property damage in the form of fouled springs and dirty ponds used for local drinking water.In an area encompassing Page, eastern Rockingham, and eastern Augusta Cos, dozens of secondary roads were deemed impassable.  Flooding was more acute in Sherando (Augusta Co) where a local dam neared its release point.  In Craigsville, several homes were slightly inundated along the Little Calfpasture River along state route 42.  In Rockingham Co, 25 roads were closed, including one with pavement failure.

Once again, damage was highlighted by downed trees, large hail, and several cases of flash flooding.  Much of the notable tree damage occurred over and east of the piedmont; flash flooding was seen over and west of the piedmont.The episode was dominated by a single supercell which developed over the west central piedmont near the Blue Ridge and propagated east through Fauquier, Prince William, Fairfax, and Arlington Cos, as well as the independent city of Alexandria.  Earlier cells caused scattered severe weather generally northwest of these areas.The first event of consequence occurred in Woodstock (Shenandoah Co), where a localized storm dumped at least 2 inches of rain in 2 hours - on top of saturated soil - producing flash flooding in portions of town.  Poor drainage and low-lying areas were hard hit, in some instances worse than the flooding in 1996 (associated with tropical storm Fran).  A two-block area was evacuated.

Additional flash flooding occurred in Warren Co, where a minor mud slide temporarily closed a portion of Browntown Road.  Low-lying flooding closed the intersection of River and Harrell Road.

Soon after, the storm exhibited a bow-echo feature, and accounts of damaging winds increased accordingly.Large hail, ranging from 0.75"" to 2"" in diameter, fell across portions of Prince William and Fairfax Cos.  Wind gusts knocked trees and large limbs down in Centreville.  Heavier damage occurred as the bow-echo strengthened, in southern Fairfax Co and Alexandria.

This time around, a cold front aided in triggering the episode, though upper-level wind shear was a major player in destabilizing the atmosphere much like it had done the previous day.  Incredibly, the 16th would be the third out of four afternoons that severe weather had occurred in some portion of northern and western Virginia.A comma-shaped line of thunderstorms - indicative of a mesoscale low pressure system - developed by the middle of the afternoon.  The comma ""head"" curled from eastern West Virginia into western Maryland, then formed a line through western and central Virginia.  Several tornadoes touched down in the vicinity of the comma head, from extreme northwestern Virginia through eastern West Virginia and northern and western Maryland; along the comma tail, individual cells produced large hail with some damaging wind gusts.Damage to trees and wires occurred in many areas but, overall, was not quite as substantial when compared to that of the 13th.  Nevertheless, several trees were uprooted, including one which fell onto an automobile, between Harrisonburg and Broadway (Rockingham Co).  Numerous trees were reported down near Craigsville (Augusta Co).  Farther east, trees were down in portions of Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William Cos.  A late storm produced damaging winds across much of Highland Co; numerous trees and wires were knocked down.A small tornado struck in and northeast of Clear Brook (northeast Frederick Co), uprooting at least 7 maple trees, smashing a storm window, flattening a barn, and snapping or uprooting 24 additional trees along Grace Church Road.  The parent thunderstorm would continue into eastern West Virginia and western Maryland, producing additional tornadoes.  Allegheny Power reported 2300 customers lost electricity in Frederick Co alone.  Another small tornado touched down in Lovettsville, causing structural damage at one residence and felling numerous trees in a 200-300 ft. wide path.  Straight-line wind damage (mainly to trees) was also noted in other areas of northwestern Loudoun Co.The main severe weather culprit this day was large hail.  Hailstones the size of baseballs dented cars, broke vehicle windows, and stripped paint and siding in portions of Madison, Augusta, Albemarle, Greene, and Culpeper Cos.  In general, hail ranged from 1 to 2.75 inches in diameter.  There were likely dozens of crop fields which sustained losses; a few residential gardens were wiped out by the large hail, which lasted 5 minutes or more in some locations.Lightning also caused some damage.  A home was set afire in Loudoun Co, causing an estimated $200 thousand in damage.  A security guard at Fort Belvoir (southern Fairfax Co) was shocked while opening a metal door; he was treated and released from the Army community hospital after slight numbness ensued.  Other lightning damage was noted in Fredericksburg; one home was struck, sustaining minor damage; there were several instances of personal electronics equipment failures (as reported by a local repair shop).Power outages were widespread; in all, Virginia Power reported approximately 64,000 customers without electricity in northern and western Virginia; Allegheny Power and several rural electric co-operatives reported at least 3,000 additional outages.",NA,PDC

The storms trained to the North-Northeast along the mountain ridges before moving very slowly east through midnight.  These storms contained very heavy rainfall, large hail, frequent lightning, and occasionally produced high winds.  Widespread flooding was reported in several locations and the storms were responsible for over a million dollars in damaged across Northern Virginia.  In Frederick County, the worst flash flooding occurred across the western portion of the county.  The hardest hit areas were in the Back Creek and Hogue Creek watersheds between Gore and Shawneeland where rainfall estimates were as high as 6 inches.  Camp Rock Enon near Gore had to be evacuated when Back Creek started to flood the property and Back Creek Road.

The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come ""off the mountain"" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path, so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado ""dropped onto it"".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.  Several roads in low lying areas in and around town were also flooded including the Greenway at mile marker 8, Evergreen Mills Road, Loudoun Street, and the intersection of the Route 15 bypass at Sycolin Road.  Three water rescues were reported.  Street flooding was observed in Purcellville.  Rainfall reports included 4.1 to 4.8 inches in Leesburg, 3.95 inches in Lincoln and Purcellville, 3.9 inches in Ashburn, 2.60 inches in Middleburg, and 2.49 inches in Lovettsville.

Hail fell from the thunderstorms in both Buchanan and Dickenson Counties, but the main problem was the severe flash flooding in the narrow valleys of northern Buchanan County.  Rains of 2.5  to 5 inches fell in a 6 to 10 hour period.  A cooperative observer at Hurley measured 4.5 inches of rain.  On the state line with West Virginia, Paynesville measured 4.1 inches.  Just south of the heaviest rain, Grundy had 2.3 inches.  Automatic gauges at Home Creek measured 3.3 inches, while another at Big Rock had 3.5 inches.  The downpours turned small streams into raging rivers, powerful enough to tumble vehicles like bath tub toys.  Mobile homes were washed away, steel bridge girders, as thick as railroad rails, were bent 90 degrees with the current.   Severe flash flooding occurred along such streams as Knox and Slate Creeks.  Communities such as Stacy, Wolford, Blackey, and Hurley were hit hard.  Hurley is situated at the junction of Lester Fork and Knox Creek.  The postmaster at Hurley said, ""it was like the mountain just opened up, and water started to come out.  All the businesses in Hurley are gone, houses are gone.  They're just gutted.""  Water rose as high as 12 feet in some buildings.   The post office at Hurley was destroyed.   A county dispatcher said, ""people were tying themselves to trees, they couldn't get helicopter assistance in, it was awful.""Around 100 homes were destroyed in Buchanan County, with 247 sustaining major damage.  On the order of 125 private bridges were washed out.  Numerous vehicles were destroyed.  The electric and phone service were severed.  Propane tanks broke loose in the flood waters.           A 37 year old man fell off a roof and was later found lying face down in the mud of a neighbor's driveway and carport.  An 84 year old man went back to his mobile home one more time, to retrieve his belongings and drowned.  President Bush declared a federal disaster for both individual and public assistance, FEMA disaster 1411.   The National Guard was activated and assisted by installing temporary bridges, then debris clearance.  Over 6,000 tons of debris were removed by the National Guard.

Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2 for several hours.||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 4 to 8 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Alleghany County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM EDT. The Governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency in the City of Covington and Alleghany County.||The phenomenal runoff from creeks, streams and overland flow produced an extreme hydrologic response on larger rivers including the Jackson River. The river gage at Covington (CVGV2) rose over 10 feet in 5 hours to reach Flood Stage (17 feet) for the first time since September 2004 (during the remains of Hurricane Jeanne).  A River Flood Warning (FLW) was issued at 609 PM as the river was near 15 feet and the crest was only 4.5 hours later at 22.33 feet just below the Major Flood Stage of 23 feet. This was highest stage reached at the Covington gage since the November 1985 flood (23.31 feet) and 2nd highest since the construction of Gathright Dam in 1979. Gathright Dam was built to reduce flooding on the Jackson River but so much rain fell in the watershed below the dam that flooding still occurred at Covington. Numerous homes and several businesses in Covington suffered severe flood damage from the Jackson River.  At the same time Dunlap Creek (DLPV2), which drains 162 mi2 of western Alleghany County and empties into the Jackson River in Covington was also rising at an extreme rate, climbing from a stage of around 3 feet (445 cfs) at 200 PM to a record stage of 16.49 feet (30,300 cfs) in a little over 6 hours.  The previous record at this gage was 15.65 feet (27,400 cfs) set in June 1972 with the remains of Hurricane Agnes. Hydrological peak stage records at this gage date back to 1929. According to USGS flood frequency reports this flood was likely in excess of a 200-year (0.005 AEP) event on Dunlap Creek. There was extensive flooding along Dunlap Creek with roads and homes flooded and some requiring evacuations. Flooding continued downstream and a few hours later a River Flood Warning was issued for the upper James River including the forecast points at Lick Run (LIRV2) and Buchanan (BNNV2) both of which easily reached flood stage. At Lick Run the crest of 22.84 feet was the 10th highest on record (continuous records since 1925) and the highest since January 1996 (25.03 feet).  Per USGS data the 48,000 cfs discharge at Lick Run was roughly a 10-year (.10 AEP) flood event. At Buchanan the 42,900 cfs was merely somewhere between a 2- to 5-year event (0.5 to 0.2 AEP).",Flash flooding was first reported in Alleghany County at 215 PM EDT (115 PM EST) as Indian Draft Road (Route 600) was closed. Numerous additional reports and social media reports continued to be received through the afternoon. Numerous small streams flooded including Wilson Creek which overflowed Route 629 (Douthat Park Road). The most serious flooding was along Dunlap Creek with runs through the southwestern portions of the county joining the Jackson River just north of Covington. More than 25 homes were badly damaged in the county most of them along Dunlap Creek which set a new flood of record (see Episode for details). Water was reported over Route 60 from Dunlap Creek in several areas. Two water rescues by boat were performed and several landslides were reported including one that was reported to have closed Pitzer Ridge Road (Route 657) east of Route 18. Three Botetourt County firefighters were injured during flood rescue operations.,CSV

The thunderstorms were fueled by deep tropical moisture, with precipitable water observed to be 1.90 inches per the August 20/00Z upper air sounding conducted by the NWS in Blacksburg.  One thunderstorm developed over the city of Roanoke shortly after 8:00 pm EDT, followed by another that moved across the city around 9:00 pm EDT.  Doppler radar estimated that between 3 and 4 inches of rain fell across portions of the city, including the downtown area, during a 75- to 90-minute period.  Two automated rain gauges, located nearby the areas of radar-estimated greatest rainfall, recorded between 2 and 2.5 inches of rain within 75 minutes, both of which are between 10- and 25-year rainfall events per NOAA Atlas 14 Point Precipitation Frequency estimates.  Given the urbanized nature of where the rainfall occurred, much of the rainfall converted directly into runoff, overwhelming the city's storm drain system.  Multiple streets near the downtown area became flooded with 1 to 2 feet of mainly standing water, but water was an estimated 4 feet deep in a few spots.  Numerous cars parked along the flooded streets had water enter the passenger area.  At least 5 water rescues were conducted by the City of Roanoke Fire & Rescue as cars attempted to drive through the flood waters and stalled.  No injuries were reported.  About an hour after heavy rain ended, the flooding had abated and most of the previously-flooded roads were passable again.  Most of this rain fell across the Tinker Creek watershed, causing the stream gauge for Tinker Creek Above Glade Creek to register a 4.5 foot rise to crest just above Action Stage (7.0 feet), before water receded again.  The National Water Model estimated the peak flow at this stream gauge to be around 2,000 cfs, which is well under a 2 year event per USGS Stream Stats.","Portions of Salem Avenue and Campbell Avenue were flooded with up to 4 feet of standing water as heavy rain overwhelmed the storm sewer system.  Five water rescues were performed as cars drove into the flood waters, causing the vehicles to stall.  No injuries were reported.  Broadcast media reported that multiple cars parked along Salem Avenue experienced water intrusion into the vehicle passenger compartments and exhaust systems, with some of the vehicle needed to be towed.",CSV

Storms then trained across the northern half of Tazewell County from around 8 pm on the 12th through about 1 am on the 13th, producing rounds of heavy rainfall rates as high as 4 inches per hour.  Two to locally six inches of rain fell across Tazewell County within 6 hours, with the heaviest amounts representing between a 500- and a 1,000-year rainfall event.","The Cooperative Weather Observer at Burkes Garden, VA (BURV2) observed water flowing over creeks and bridges near their home in the community of Burkes Garden due to between 2.5 and 3.5 inches of rainfall.  No damage was reported with this flooding.",CSV

The east winds around this low, allowed deep sub-tropical moisture from the Atlantic to move into lower Mid-Atlantic region. Areas of rain developed across the mountains by late morning, and gradually increased in coverage due to the sustained 25 to 30 knot (850mb) moisture inflow. Precipitable water values were observed in the 1.2 to 1.3 inch range through the day into the early morning hours of the 29th, which is around the 75th percentile for late May. Through the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th, the upper low drifted eastward, allowing instability to increase across the central Appalachians as the associated pocket of cooler upper level temperatures approached. While Surface-based CAPE levels remained minimal during the event, Most-Unstable CAPE (MUCAPE) values were observed climbing across the mountains through the evening of the 28th into morning of the 29th, reaching into the 600 to 850 J/Kg range. Combined with orographic lift, this instability supported the development of low-topped thunderstorms with enhanced rainfall rates.  As rainfall totals increased across the mountains and soils approached saturation, flash flood guidance values were lowered to under an inch at the 1- and 3-hour time periods. ||The heavy rain then led to flooding of Wolf Creek and Walker Creek. Elsewhere, training cells across Floyd and Franklin Counties resulted in minor flooding of the South Fork of the Roanoke River, which brought the Roanoke River up to Action Stage as it passed through the Cities of Roanoke and Salem.",Heavy rain caused Laurel Creek to flood out of its banks and enter two homes on Laurel Fork Road.

This resulted in areas of flash flooding, mainly in the headwaters of the Smith River and the Ararat River. ||The event began with a stationary front draped near the border of Virginia and North Carolina early on the 28th as an upper level disturbance began passing across the lower Great Lakes, placing the central Appalachians in an area of lift. The disturbance triggered a southeasterly wind shift across the foothills of the Blue Ridge in southern Virginia and northern North Carolina, bringing an increase of deep moisture northeast from the Piedmont of North Carolina. Precipitable water values were estimated to|be 1.9 to 2.1 inches across Patrick and Carroll counties by 3:00 am on the 28th, while Mixed-Layer CAPE values remained around 500 J/Kg through much of the night.||Convection initiated after sunset on the 27th as a few slow-moving showers across southern Patrick County. Coverage and intensity of the slow-moving activity only increased as the evening progressed, with a band of showers and embedded storms forming along the Highway 58 corridor by midnight, that was advancing northeast toward the crest of the Blue Ridge. Deep moisture combined with orographic lift to produce extremely efficient rainfall rates that were, at times, ranging from 3 to 5 inches per hour across Patrick County into neighboring Carroll County. Doppler Radar estimated rainfall totals of nearly 11 inches of rainfall in northern Patrick County across the Smith River basin, which was confirmed by one CoCoRaHS report of 10.70 inches, as well as a Cooperative Observer report from Woolwine of 10.62 inches. The stream gage at the Smith River near Woolwine (SMWV2) rose to 11.04 feet, just above moderate flood stage due to this rainfall, however radar estimates put the highest amounts downstream of this gage.  Few reports of flooding impacts were received, however it was noted that Philpott Reservoir rose 3 feet in response to the inflows from the Smith River. In western Patrick County and southeast Carroll County, 4 to 7 inches of rain fell across the entire headwaters of the Ararat River, with radar estimates of around 9 inches near the town of Ararat, VA.

Strong southerly wind flow ahead of the upper trough carried deep moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Carolinas and the lower Mid-Atlantic.  Precipitable water values ranged from 1.1 inches across north-central Virginia to nearly 1.5 inches over the border between Virginia and North Carolina by early afternoon on the 9th, or anywhere between two and three standard deviations above normal for January.  Precipitation fell mainly as rain during a 12 to 15 hour period on the 9th, mostly at rates of a half inch per hour or less.  However, a convective band pushed from North Carolina across the foothills and Piedmont of southern Virginia during the afternoon, producing rates of locally two inches per hour.  Rainfall totals varied from 1.5 to 2.5 inches for portions of Virginia located west of the Blue Ridge Parkway, and between 2.5 and 3.5 inches along and further east of the parkway, averaging between 2-year and 5-year precipitation totals for a 12 hour duration per NOAA Atlas 14 Point Precipitation Frequency estimates.  Given that multiple precipitation events having passed across the region since late November 2023 had allowed stream flows and soil moisture to improve from the Moderate to Severe Drought conditions, the region was more susceptible to flooding.  The long-duration rainfall event allowed streams to rise gradually, making for numerous instances of mainly minor areal and riverine flooding.  However, flash flooding occurred across the Piedmont, particularly across Pittsylvania County, in the wake of the convective band.  Multiple roads and bridges were reported flooded and impassible because of the rainfall, with a few becoming severely damaged.","After around 1.75 inches of rain had fallen over a roughly 10 hour period, a line of heavy rainfall, producing rates of 1.5 inches per hour, passed across Pittsylvania County, bringing a half inch to three quarters of rain over a short period of time. This resulted in numerous instances of flash flooding throughout the county.  Runoff from this rain caused Green Rock Branch to overflow its banks at least six inches deep across Concord Road.  Motleys Mill Road washed out near the intersection with Halifax Road, causing an estimated 50 thousand dollars worth of damage.  Halifax Road was also observed flooded.  Sycamore Creek was observed overflowing its banks several inches deep across Country Club Road.  Extensive damage occurred near the intersection of Walkers Well Road and Toshes Road, with three layers of the road surface washed away, causing an estimated 25 thousand dollars of damage.  Long Branch Creek was observed overflowing its banks several inches deep across Player Road, leaving a large amount of debris on the roadway.  Fall Creek rose several inches out of its banks, flooding the southbound lane of N. Main Street near Fall Creek Drive.

White Ridge Road was submerged several inches deep as Barker Creek overflowed its banks.  Cedar Creek was observed overflowing its banks at least several inches deep Graves Bridge Road.  Little Bearskin Creek was reported out of its banks several inches deep over Hollywood Road.  Anderson Mill Road was completely washed out and impassible near the intersection with Old Red Eye Road, causing an estimated 50 thousand dollars worth of damage.  Both Countryside Drive and Hillside Drive was observed with several inches of water flowing across the roadway surface.  Shawnee Road was observed flooded several inches deep between Sandy Bottom Road and Camp Shawnee Road.  Green Rock Branch was observed flowing well outside of its banks.  Both Berry Hill Road and Stateline Bridge Road were observed flooded several inches deep by flowing water.  Fall Creek Road was observed flooded by nearby Cane Creek overflowing its banks.

A strong southeast flow of wind on the system's northern extent, along with wet soils due to heavy rainfall, helped to cause downed trees and power lines over portions of Virginia. Winds gusted to at least 40 to 45 mph over parts of the region. The strong winds continued into the morning hours of August 9th, 2024.  The highest totals were observed in a swath stretching from Patrick and Franklin Counties through southern Botetourt and Bedford, including the Cities of Roanoke and Salem, where three to five inches were recorded, amounts that were generally 10-year average recurrence interval (ARI) events per NOAA Atlas 14 Point Precipitation Frequency estimates. Another swath of similar amounts was observed from Charlotte County through central Buckingham County.  Rainfall amounts for most of the remainder of of central Virginia were under three inches and generally less than 10-year ARI events. There were|long breaks in between rainfall bands, with many areas receiving only light to occasionally moderate rainfall for two to three hours, which helped diminish the flooding threat. Another factor that decreased the flash flooding potential were antecedent soil conditions and streamflows that were near to below normal from drought conditions occurring earlier in the summer. As a result, bands of heavy rain did cause several fist and second order streams to flood rapidly out of their banks, making nearby roads impassible for several hours until the water receded. The Dan River rose to minor flood stage at South Boston.","Jacobs Road was flooded and impassible as Little Sycamore Creek overflowed its banks several inches deep across the road. No damage was reported to the road, and it was open to traffic after the water receded.",CSV

The highest totals were observed in a swath stretching from Patrick and Franklin Counties through southern Botetourt and Bedford, including the Cities of Roanoke and Salem, where three to five inches were recorded, amounts that were generally 10-year average recurrence interval (ARI) events per NOAA Atlas 14 Point Precipitation Frequency estimates. Another swath of similar amounts was observed from Charlotte County through central Buckingham County.  Rainfall amounts for most of the remainder of of central Virginia were under three inches and generally less than 10-year ARI events. There were|long breaks in between rainfall bands, with many areas receiving only light to occasionally moderate rainfall for two to three hours, which helped diminish the flooding threat. Another factor that decreased the flash flooding potential were antecedent soil conditions and streamflows that were near to below normal from drought conditions occurring earlier in the summer. As a result, bands of heavy rain did cause several fist and second order streams to flood rapidly out of their banks, making nearby roads impassible for several hours until the water receded.

Two to 2 and a half inches of rain fell across the city, with one local weather station observed a total of 2.25 inches occurring during a 45-minute period. MRMS Crest Unit Stream flow in the City of Martinsville was observed to be 1,540 cfs/mi^2 at 6 pm EDT, with any values above 1,000 cfs/mi^2 being very strong indicators for the potential of flash flooding.","An short-duration but high-intensity thunderstorm passed across the City of Martinsville, bringing 2 to 2.5 inches of rain in less than an hour.  The intensity of rainfall overwhelmed storm drains, causing water to back up onto several city streets.  Multiple roads became flooded and impassible by several inches of flowing water, and remained closed until the water drained away, with no damage to the roadways reported.  About 6 inches of water was observed flowing across the intersection of Memorial Boulevard and Bridge Street.  At least one road was flooded near Southside Park, with multiple vehicles becoming stranded in the floodwaters while attempting to drive through it.  The damage estimate is the damage caused to vehicles becoming stranded in the flood waters.",CSV
