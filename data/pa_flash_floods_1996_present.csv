Most of the heavy rain was over by 7 a.m. EDT, except it lingered in Monroe County through the morning.  No serious injuries were reported. Storm totals included 2.63 inches in Pottstown, 2.45 inches in Tannersville, 2.42 inches in Hopewell Village,  2.40 inches in Walnutport, 2.35 inches in Tobyhanna, 2.28 inches in Hamburg, 2.05 inches in Palm, 2.00 inches in Reading and 1.89 inches in Allentown.

Significant widespread flooding of streams, rivers, homes and businesses, streets and highways, woodlands, and farmland occurred as a result of rapid snowmelt and nearly simultaneous storm runoff. Every county in northeast Pennsylvania experienced road closures due to washouts, mudslides, and failed, damaged, or weakened bridges. Evacuation of one hundred thousand to one hundred and ten thousand people was ordered at 11 PM on January 19th in Luzerne County (including much of Wilkes-Barre). The Susquehanna River at Wilkes-Barre was forecast to crest at 35 to 36 feet, just below the top of the 37 foot levee. Surrounding areas of the Wyoming Valley, unprotected by the levees, were inundated by runoff, the Lackawanna River, and the Susquehanna River when it crested at 34.42 feet at Wilkes-Barre, well above the 22 foot flood stage. The American Red Cross reported that at the height of the evacuation, only five thousand people were housed in the mass care centers, even though the evacuated areas were like ghosttowns. Nearly every county declared a county-wide State of Emergency with remaining counties having locally declared States of Emergency on January 19th. Most States of Emergency were lifted by late on January 20th. Small-scale evacuations of homes and/or businesses were experienced by many counties within the region.      A strong low pressure system tracked northward across the Great Lakes on the morning of the 19th, bringing mild air into the region on strong southerly winds gusting to 45 MPH. The strong winds played a significant role in eroding the snowpack - snow depths by sunrise on the 19th ranged from only a few inches to bare ground, down from depths of one to two and a half feet the day before! Water equivalents of the eroded snowpack ranged from two and a half to five inches.      During the early morning hours of the 19th, a line of heavy rain showers and embedded thunderstorms developed ahead of a strong cold front. Streams and creeks were approaching bankfull due to runoff from the snowmelt. Rainfall intensified over the region as the front slowed its eastward progress. Rainfall amounts ahead of the front were generally between one and a half and two and a half inches, with many locations receiving rainfall rates of one-half to one inch in an hour. Serious flooding of streams and creeks began across Bradford County during the early morning, and flooding commenced across the remainder of northeast Pennsylvania during the afternoon as the heavy rain moved east. The cold front moved across the region during the afternoon, causing temperatures to drop from the 50s into the 20s, and the rain to change to snow (with some areas receiving a period of sleet and/or freezing rain) in only one to two hours. The rapid drop in temperature that caused standing water to freeze rapidly, in concert with the one to two inches of snow that accumulated in most areas by evening, created very slippery conditions throughout northeast Pennsylvania.      Flash floods that began early on the 19th gave rise to main stem river flooding that persisted through the evening of the 21st.  Near record river flooding occurred on January 19th and 20th over the upper Susquehanna River basin. At Meshoppen, in Wyoming County, the Susquehanna River crested at its second highest level of all time, at 36.34 feet, which was about seven feet lower than the all time crest of 43.51 feet recorded on June 23, 1972. The 34.42 foot crest at Wilkes-Barre was the third highest on record, well below the 40.91 foot crest recorded on June 24, 1972. On the Lackawanna River at Old Forge, in Lackawanna County, the crest of 15.57 feet on the 19th was the fourth highest on record, well below the highest crest of 20.05 feet recorded on August 19, 1955. Most forecast points had fallen below flood stage by the evening of January 21.",NA,PDC

Two major snowstorms set the stage for the great flood.   The snow storm of January 7-8 had been termed the Blizzard of '96 and was followed by a second major storm on January 12-13.  Overnight on the 18th and through the morning of the 19th, heavy rain fell atop snow that had been ripened exceptionally rapidly by high winds and warm temperatures.  In many areas flooding was as bad as flooding from Hurricane Eloise of 1975, and in a few spots even worse than record floods of Agnes in 1972.In the hardest hit areas of central Pennsylvania, 14 deaths were directly attributed to the flooding.  Estimates of damages from the combined flood and the prior weeks blizzard (that set the stage for the flood) totaled $700 million for the state.  An estimated $760 million was also lost to commerce over the two weeks.  PENNDOT further estimated damage to roads and bridges of $500 million.  Flood damage figures included damage to more than 51,000 homes (7,731 with major damage or destroyed), 1,900 business, 1,426 roads and 78 parks.  More than 200,000 people were evacuated at some time during the event.On of the hardest hit areas was along Lycoming Creek north of Williamsport in Lycoming County where 6 deaths were confirmed.  Stream levels in Lycoming County exceeded record levels set during Agnes.  In Elk county flood levels on the Clarion River also exceeded levels from Agnes.Many locations had in excess of 2 inches of rain, with the hardest hit receiving 3 inches in less than 12 hours.  Snowpack held water equivalents of 2 to 4 inches across much of the region from the severe January snowstorms, and much of the water was released during the period of heavy rain.  Even major rivers and streams reacted quite rapidly, and ice jams caused significant problems in many areas.Many of the deaths were in stranded automobiles that people drove into floooded areas.  A combination of strong winds, temperatures that fell into the teens and ice cold waters meant there was little time to rescue people caught in the flood.",NA,PDC

The 11.55 inches of rain that fell in Langhorne represented a greater than one hundred year single day storm.  Two men drowned, a 54-year-old and a 52-year-old.  Damage was estimated at 14.5 million dollars, 13 million to property and 1.5 million to state and local roads.  A state of emergency was declared that evening.  The county was declared a major disaster area later in the month.  Ninety people escaped possible injury by evacuating Gold's Gym in Middletown Township just before the roof collapsed from the heavy rain at 610 p.m. EDT.   Nearly every major roadway was made impassable by the torrential downpours including Pennsylvania State Route 413 and U.S. Routes 1 and 13.  Even Interstate 95 was closed at 8 p.m. EDT in Penndel Borough.  Creeks that flooded included the Neshaminy, Brock, Mill, Queen Anne, Indian, Silver and Deer Run. The hardest hit townships were Middletown ($11.5 million in damage), Falls, Lower Makefield and Bristol.  The hardest hit boroughs within these towns were Bristol, Langhorne, Morrisville, Penndel and Yardley.  Seven bridges were washed out.  Four homes were destroyed, 62 suffered major damage, 215 had moderate damage and 381 incurred minor damage.  About 30 businesses were also damaged including a bowling alley in Langhorne that was ruined. The first fatality occurred about 8 p.m. EDT.  A 52 year-old-man on his way to his daughter's cancelled graduation drove his car into the Silver Creek.  The vehicle plunged about 15 feet into the swollen creek.  His body was found near the 15th hole of the adjacent Yardley Country Club.  Before he arrived, the creek had washed out the single lane 107-year-old bridge on Reading Avenue.  Ironically another woman was probably saved because her vehicle  landed on top of his.  She managed to get out of her car and clinged to a tree until she was rescued.  The second fatality occurred about 1230 a.m. EDT on the 13th in Penn Valley/Falls Township.  A 54-year-old man's vehicle stalled in four feet of water on Newbold Road near the Penn Warner Industrial Park.  He rescued his mother from the flood waters, but returned to his car.  He was then plowed over by a wall of water from a passing truck.  His body was found near his vehicle's bumper.Middletown Township had the most flood damage.  The worst was along the Mill Creek and on Wyoming Avenue.  In the Penndel Borough dozens of people were trapped on the second floor of their homes on Wyoming and Delaware Avenues.   Two hundred shoppers at the Oxford Valley mall were stranded until about midnight EDT.  Flooding along the Mill Creek continued through Bristol Township.   Boats were used to rescue stranded motorists.  The Bristol Senior Citizen Center was submerged in four feet of water.  Four bridges were washed out in Falls Township and emergency personnel waded in four feet of water to rescue stranded motorists.  In Lower Makefield Township, the flooding washed out the SEPTA train tracks.  Cars were pushed out of the driveways onto the streets by the flood waters.  Three bridges were washed away.  In Yardley Borough, flooding along the Brock and Silver Creeks and the Canal inundated the area again for the second time this year.  About 200 to 300 persons were rescued.  Cars were buried in water.  Evacuations were ordered between the Canal and Delaware River.  Officials feared gas explosions from eroded roadways and exposed lines.  Power was not restored until Friday the 14th.  In Bensalem, the Neshaminy Creek flooded.  A 40 foot boat and its dock were ripped from their moorings and smashed into the U.S. Route 13 Bridge.  Farther upstream the Neshaminy Creek in Langhorne crested at 11.8 feet at 115 a.m. EDT.  Flood stage is 9 feet.              In addition to the 11.55 inches of rain that fell near the Oxford Valley Mall, other reported rainfall amounts included 9 inches at the Middletown Country Club, 6.1 inches in Yardley, 5 inches in Neshaminy Falls, 4.8 inches in Richboro and 3.3 inches in Southampton.",NA,PDC

Up to 10 inches of rain within a three hour period.  The 10 inches of rain was measured at the water treatment plant off Fitzwatertown Road in Abington.  This corresponded well with the Doppler Radar rainfall estimates of locations surrounding the severe flooding.  Tropical moisture left behind by the remnants of Hurricane Fran was a major contributor to the torrential downpours.  States of emergency were declared by several Montgomery County townships.  Governor Ridge declared a disaster emergency for the county on the 10th and the county was declared a federal emergency disaster area the night of the 13th.The most significant flooding occurred along the Sandy Run Creek in Abington.  The creek runs about 100 to 150 feet behind the houses on Madison Avenue.  Madison Avenue was where the flooding related deaths occurred and where most of the eight destroyed houses were.  Heavy rain began falling around 430 p.m. EDT and by 530 p.m. EDT water rescues were starting.  A 73-year-old man went into the basement of his Madison Avenue house to start bailing out the water.  His 71-year-old wife moved their vehicle to higher ground.  Around 630 p.m. EDT when she returned,  her husband was in cardiac arrest.  She called the paramedics and remained with her husband.  As the creek continued to rise, it flooded most of the homes on the south side of Madison Avenue.  The flood waters literally pushed in the back foundation of the house and the couple was trapped and drowned within the rising wall of water within their basement.  The water line reached up to 8 feet above ground level. The National Weather Service Survey team estimated the creek at its highest was about 14 feet above the creek bed.  The flooding along Madison Avenue was exacerbated by a fallen tree that acted as a debris dam across the creek just downstream from the Madison Avenue neighborhood.  As the water continued to rise, debris built up against the downed tree.  After the water receded about a dozen motor vehicles were removed from that portion of the creek bed. The Johnston and Fernwood neighborhoods had the second worse damage in the township.  They were located less than half a mile upstream from Madison Avenue.  The Sandy Run Creek also runs about 75 feet on the south side of Fernwood Avenue.  Backyard garages, swimming pools and several vehicles were destroyed.  At least two dozen homes sustained flood damage.  The Roslyn Elementary School suffered about $750,000 in flood damage as water rushed downhill from the Hillside Cemetary into the school.  Water levels reached 10 feet within the school's basement and destroyed its cafeteria and boiler.  The flooding extended upward into the first floor and damaged 12 of the 21 classrooms.  Flooding also damaged six classrooms in the Saint John the Cross School.  About 30 people attending a baby shower escaped injury by evacuating from the Rosyln Boy's Club about 30 minutes before the building collapsed.  A rentention basin filled and then flooded the Willow Grove Shopping Center.   In all, within Abington Township 8 homes were destroyed, most along Madison Avenue.  There were also about 550 homes and apartments that were damaged, 120 of which had major damage.  About 75 businesses were either damaged or destroyed, 80 roads and bridges and several rail lines were damaged.  The Sandy Run Creek was declared a major debris site.  Pennsylvania State Route 152 or Limekiln Pike was badly damaged and was expected to remain close for about a month.  The Sandy Run Golf Course was under 8 feet of water.Other locations in Montgomery County also were flooded.  About 40 homes in Springfield Township were damaged as the Wissahickon Creek flooded.  The Sandy Run Creek drains into the Wissahickon.  The Oreland section was the hardest hit with residents from 7 homes evacuated.  In Upper Dublin Township, 7 homes were damaged.  Ten vehicle rescues were performed from 530 to 930 p.m. EDT.  A 14-year-old was stranded in a tree for 45 minutes.  Sections of Fitzwatertown Road were washed out. In Upper Moreland Township, 23 businesses, 11 houses and 7 apartment buildings suffered flood damage.  Vehicles were floating in the Willow Grove Shopping Center.  In Whitemarsh Township, 30 people were rescued by boat from the Day's Hotel. Twenty-seven other persons were evacuated and a dozen cars became submerged in flood waters.  Three people were rescued from a van's roof.  In Cheltenham Township, school was canceled on Monday the 9th, after flooding damaged 35 of their school buses and 20 of its vans.  Countywide damage was estimated at $20,000,000.  In addition to the 10 inch rainfall report at the water treatment plant off Fitzwatertown in Abington, 5.42 inches of rain fell at the Willow Grove N.A.S. in Horsham Township and 4.6 inches in Glenside (south of Abington Township).",NA,PDC

The storm dropped near 4 inches of rain in about 90 minutes over a 4 square-mile area.  The resulting flash flood was centered in a small watershed in and near Pitcairn.  Radar estimated rainfall rates greater than 2 inches per hour for almost 40 minutes.  A rain gage at the Gateway Middle School indicated 3.30 inches storm total.  Most of the damage was along Dirty Camp Run and Abers Creek.   The town of Pitcairn was particularly hard hit.  The streambed of Dirty Camp Run, a tributary of Turtle Creek, flows through the heart of the urbanized area of Pitcairn, where the channel is made of stoneblock and mortar.  The channel flows directly under an elementary school.  During the height of the flood, water was flowing through the lower level windows of the school and several walls were destroyed.  The basement of a church was also completely flooded.The ferocious flood waters shoved homes from their foundations and floated and overturned numerous vehicles in the flood water's path.  Approximately 429 homes, 12 businesses, 2 sewer systems, 1 park and 13 roads and bridges were affected in Pitcairn, Monroeville, Turtle Creek and Wilkins Township.  Thirteen structures in Pitcairn were moved from their foundations.  There were some indications of possible debris damming upstream of the greatest damage in the 5 to 6 square city block area near the lowest part of the town.A mudslide was reported along Route 22 at a gas station near the Pennsylvania Turnpike entrance.    At the intersections of Routes 130 and 48, a 15 foot bridge across a Turtle Creek Tributary was washed out.

Rainfall storm totals exceeded 6 inches across parts of Fulton, Bedford, Huntingdon and Blair counties with 3-5 inches falling across adjacent counties. Highest reported amount was 7.38 inches at Saxton in northeast Bedford County with 6.80 inches in Orbisonia in Huntingdon County. Heavy rains developed across the region late Friday morning with rainfall reports beginning to exceed 2 inches shortly before noon. Rains would continue across the area through the afternoon and evening before diminishing in the early morning hours Saturday. Small streams overflowed, basements flooded and many roads were closed across the region. Major roads including Routes 22, 522, and 219 were closed for much of the day Saturday. One death was indirectly attributed to the flooding. An 82 year old male died of a heart attack after his vehicle stalled on Goodman Road in Morris Township, Huntingdon County, around 2:15 p.m. Saturday afternoon. He succumbed while attempting to wade to dry land. Evacuation shelters were open in many counties. Water overflowed the emergency spillway of the Bakerton Dam in West Carroll Township of Cambria County. Eight families were advised to evacuate to a shelter at Carrolltown Fire Hall. Upper branches of the Juniata River flooded with the Frankstown Branch at Williamsburg cresting close to 18 feet, which is classified as near record flooding.",PDC

Storm totals ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 inches. The highest storm totals were in Bucks and Monroe Counties.  The lowest occurred in Chester County.  Overall there were few periods of heavy downpours and there were sufficient lulls of light rain or drizzle to keep most small streams within bankfull.  The only gaged streams that briefly exceeded bankfull were the Wissahickon within Philadelphia and the Perkiomen Creek in Schwenksville (Montgomery County).  Flooding problems were confined to flooded basements, backyards and some poor drainage flooding.  The heaviest rain for any given day during this event was mainly Friday the 8th.   The axis of heavy rain slowly shifted northward over the weekend.  The  heaviest rain on Saturday the 9th through Monday the 11th fell across sections of the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos.  Precipitation totals on the 12th were generally under a quarter of an inch throughout the region. Tuesday May 12th also marked the 12th consecutive day that any precipitation (trace or greater) fell at the Philadelphia International Airport.  This tied the monthly record for the month of May previously set in 1894.Heavy rain the evening of the 8th caused some minor flooding along the Perkiomen Creek in Schwenksville.  The creek crested at about 7.5 feet.  Flood stage is estimated at 7 feet.  Heavy rain the evening of the 8th also  caused the Wissahickon Creek in Philadelphia to crest at its flood stage of 5.0 feet at about 10:45 p.m. EDT.Storm totals included 5.07 inches in Springtown (Bucks County),  4.70 inches in Tobyhanna (Monroe County), 4.65 inches in Chadds Ford (Delaware County), 4.44 inches in Mount Pocono (Monroe County), 4.06 inches in Perkasie (Bucks County),  3.83 inches at the Willow Grove NAS (Montgomery County), 3.77 inches in Crum Creek (Delaware County), 3.63 inches in Valley Forge (Montgomery County), 3.45 inches in Easton (Northampton County), 3.44 inches in Palm (Montgomery County) and the Northeast Philadelphia Airport, 3.26 inches in Glenmoore (Chester County), 3.13 inches at the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 3.05 inches at the Philadelphia International Airport, 2.86 inches in Hamburg (Berks County), 2.76 inches in Reading (Berks County) and 2.24 inches in Lehighton (Carbon County). A low pressure system heading toward the Middle Atlantic States was in the lower Ohio Valley the morning of the 7th.  By the morning of the 8th, it moved into northern Indiana as a secondary was forming in Virginia.  On the morning of the 9th, this secondary low was located about 325 miles southeast of Philadelphia.  But, it became trapped by a low at upper levels of our atmosphere and drifted slowly south through the morning of the 10th.  Meanwhile, a large high pressure system started building into Northern New England.  Yet  another low pressure system developed over the Southern Plains on the 9th and was in the Tennessee Valley the morning of the 10th. On the morning of the 11th, two low pressure systems, one trapped under the closed low in the western Atlantic and the other just east of Charleston, South Carolina continued the wet onshore flow.  These two lows merged into one by the morning of the 12th about 275 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and remained nearly stationary through the 14th.  The high pressure system over Northern New England slowly built south and brought drier air into the region and gave the area its first rain-free days of the month on the 13th and 14th.",NA,PDC

The thunderstorms first started in west-central Lawrence County and moved southeast at about 30 to 35 MPH into northeast Beaver County.  An additional storm developed in northeast Beaver County and merged with the first storm in the northwestern part of the county.  Together they combined into an intense thunderstorm complex which produced a swath of wind damage across Western Pennsylvania that punched southeastward through southwest Butler, much of Allegheny, northeast Washington, southwest Westmoreland and northern Fayette counties.  Hundreds of trees and power lines were snapped and toppled.  Approximately 110,000 customers lost power in Allegheny County alone.  This power outage was larger than the one that occurred during the  June 2nd, 1998 tornado which struck the Mt. Washington section of Pittsburgh. Air traffic at the Pittsburgh International Airport was suspended for nearly four hours.  There were also several instances of structural damage to homes and businesses in the form of roof, shingle, and siding damage.  Some small out-building and sheds were also damaged or destroyed.  This rather long-lived macroburst event had an approximate path length of 85 miles and stretched across parts of seven counties.  The width varied from approximately a mile or so to as much as 12 to 14 miles wide, especially across parts of Allegheny County.  Spotters provided several reports of winds reaching 60 to 70 MPH, with some reports as high as 85 MPH.  This macroburst event is comparable in size and strength to the June 30th, 1998 event which roared across Beaver, Allegheny and Westmoreland counties in Western Pennsylvania.  In addition to the damaging winds, the storms produced torrential amounts of rainfall which flooded roadways, under-passes and other low-lying areas, stranding several people in their cars.  Several mud and rock slides were also reported.  There were numerous reports of basement flooding across the region.  The Pittsburgh International Airport reported a record-setting 3.48 inches of rain for the day.","Thunderstorms moving across southern portions of the county deposited up to 3.7 inches of rainfall, producing roadway and localized basement flooding in the cities of Sharon and Mercer.",PDC

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around six inches in the Poconos and Berks County,  eight inches in the Lehigh Valley and from eight to twelve inches in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.  Six people died directly from the hurricane - four drownings and two persons were hit by trees.  The hurricane also indirectly contributed to the death of about seven other persons.  About 40 persons were seriously injured. There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About  7,000 persons were evacuated, more than half were from Delaware and Bucks Counties, the two hardest hit counties in the state.  The Preliminary damage estimate was 60 million dollars. Damage to infrastructure was around 20 million dollars and hundreds of roads and dozens of bridges were damaged or closed.  A couple of bridges in Bucks County are not expected to be reopened until 2001. About 200 houses were seriously damaged or destroyed, another 1,000 were damaged but still inhabitable.  Over 10,000 homes were flooded.  Over 500 apartments were also damaged as were over 100 businesses. The flooding affected fourteen key regional rail service lines around Philadelphia, many were closed and/or damaged. About 501,000 homes and businesses lost power - 412,000 in the PECO Service area in Southeast Pennsylvania, the second worst outage in the company's history.   School children were dismissed early. Sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers. The first directly related hurricane death occurred in East Nottingham Township in Chester County.  A 53-year-old woman was crushed when a tree fell through her house.  In Montgomery County three persons drowned in their vehicles when they attempted to drive across flooded roadways.  One drove around barricades.  A 49-year-old male was found inside his vehicle in the Perkiomen Creek in Perkiomen Valley Park.  His disabled vehicle apparently was swept into the creek.  A 73-year-old woman was found inside her vehicle in the Wissahickon Creek in Whitemarsh Township.  Her vehicle was swept off the road and became pinned against a tree along the banks of the creek.  A 47-year-old man in West Conshohocken drowned after he drove around barricades and became stuck in flood waters.  His father who was a passenger in the car escaped.  In Delaware County, a 67-year-old man drowned in Darby Borough while delivering pizzas.  His van was caught in the swirling waters of the Darby Creek.  In Philadelphia, a 48-year-old man was crushed by a fallen tree as he was waiting for a green light in Fairmount Park.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd contributed to the death of a family (3 persons) on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Chester County and a 44 year-old man in Upper Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County.  Two other men in Montgomery County (a 61-year-old and a 51-year-old) suffered heart attacks and died while trying to remove water from his basement and while being evacuated.  A third (67-year-old) man died of a heart attack in Chester County (West Whiteland Township) while trying to push his vehicle from flood waters on Pennsylvania State Route 100.   The highest verifiable storm total was 12.13 inches in Marcus Hook (Delaware County).  Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest precipitation coincided near the ""fall line"" in Southeast Pennsylvania.  The fall line is the boundary between the coastal plain and the Piedmont and represents the first significant rise of the land from near sea level.  The onshore flow being lifted over this geographic feature dumped the heaviest rain around this area and fell across northern Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and Lower Montgomery and Bucks Counties.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in locations in and around the ""fall line"" and several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crests on record.  The combination of winds funneling up Delaware Bay and the river and the record runoff from inland waterways produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Delaware, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties.   Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees. Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Berks County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved westward, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category (Major) IV Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was also a very large in size hurricane that would prolong the extent of both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward along the fall line and dropped the heaviest rain near this geographic feature.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 5 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into the Poconos by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain crossed the Mason/Dixon Line. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state.   But the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Floyd hit Bucks County the hardest, especially in the Neshaminy Creek Basin.  The Neshaminy Creek had its second highest crest on record only surpassed by Hurricanes Connie and Diane in 1955.  About 2,000 people were evacuated and numerous rescues occurred.  In Buckingham Township, 11 school children and the bus driver were rescued after being stranded in the Mill Creek.   Twenty-nine homes were destroyed, 80 other were damaged or uninhabitable and 304 others were damaged but still inhabitable.  Thirty-two businesses were damaged or destroyed, twelve public buildings or pieces of equipment were destroyed and eighteen public parks were damaged.  Flooding was extensive along the Neshaminy Basin from Warrington Township to Bristol Township.  In Middletown Township homes along Bridle Drive and Periwinkle Avenue were severely flooded.  One house was swept 10 feet off its foundation.  Several underground heating oil tanks erupted.  In Northampton Township, every bridge over the Neshaminy Creek was closed.  Many cars became stranded after driving around barricades.  Persons were rescued from car tops.  The Langhorne Players Building was destroyed. In Warrington Township five homes along the Little Neshaminy Creek were deemed uninhabitable. The second hard hit area was in townships along the Delaware River as the evening high tide slowed the discharge of streams into the river.  Evacuations occurred along the Delaware River in Yardley and Lower Makefield Township, two people were rescued from 10 feet of water.  Elsewhere in the county, flooding along the East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek forced the evacuation of downtown Sellersville.  In Upper Southampton Township, two homes collapsed because of the heavy rain.   Nearly every creek and even some lakes (Silver Lake in Bristol Borough) overflowed. High winds also took their toll.  A Perkasie woman was injured trying to remove a downed tree.  A fallen tree severely damaged a house in Falls Township.  The SEPTA Regional rail service to trenton was stopped because of downed trees on the tracks. Seventy roads were closed and included long stretches of Pennsylvania State Route 611. Seven roads were too damaged to be reopened in Buckingham, Lower Makefield and Upper Makefield Townships.  They were still closed on the 25th.  Pennsylvania State Route 32 in Solebury Township was expected to be closed indefinitely.  Bridges were damaged or washed out in Buckingham, Durham, Solebury, Upper Makefield and Wrightstown Townships. Three bridges were destroyed and were not expected to be reopened until 2001.  They are River Road (Pennsylvania State Route 32) over the Jericho Creek in Upper Makefield Township, New Hope Road over the Mill Creek in Buckingham Townships and Swamp Road over the Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township.  Delaware County was the second hardest hit county in the state, but no location was hit harder than Darby Borough as flooding along the Darby and Cobb Creeks cut off and decimated the borough.  Seven hundred people were evacuated, one hundred were rescued by boat, 11 were plucked from flood waters. The creek devoured residents and businesses along Mill and Walnut Streets. Twenty-five businesses were in ruin; a bank and liquor store disappeared under eight feet of flood water. A delivery van floated into six 2,000 gallon tanks containing toxic solvents, four were recovered.  An ice machine was recovered half a mile downstream.  The Colwyn section of Lansdowne Borough was also hard hit  by the Darby Creek flooding.  During the evening of the 16th about 1,000 persons were evacuated in the Crum Creek Valley in Marple, Media, Nether Providence, Ridley, Swarthmore, and Upper Providence Townships.  Officials feared the record rainfall would damage the Springton Reservoir Dam's spillway.  Other evacuations occurred along the Chester Creek in Aston, Brookhaven, Chester City and Upland Borough.  The Chester Creek in Chester had its second highest crest on record since 1971. Tidal flooding also forced the evacuation of about 500 people along the Delaware River in Marcus Hook.  Flooding forced evacuations along the Marcus Hook in Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough. Intense flooding along Pennsylvania State Route 291 forced the evacuation of 200 people in Tinicum Township. Numerous roads were closed and several were damaged.  Two were still closed on the 21st. Numerous water rescues occurred. A Lansdowne firefighter was injured while trying to rescue several children stuck in a tree. A 58-year-old woman was injured when she inadvertently lit an M80 instead of a candle. Mud reached three to four feet high in the business district of Aston Township.  The high winds downed numerous trees across the county.  One tree damaged a home in Media Borough.   Delaware and Chester Counties bore the brunt of the power outages in PECO Energy's service area.   In Montgomery County, about 1,500 persons were evacuated.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas of Abington, Collegeville, Conshohocken, Lower Moreland, Upper Dublin, Upper Moreland and West Norriton Townships.   In Upper Dublin Township, 100 residents and 65 children were evacuated after water overflowed the top of the Loch Alsh Reservoir. Numerous water rescues occurred, some from car tops. In Conshohocken, a regional rail car became surrounded by 6 feet of flood waters from the Plymouth Creek quickly. Ten people were trapped.  A rescue boat sent capsized and several passengers clung to a tree for a couple of hours before finally being rescued.  About 75 persons were rescued from flood waters in Upper Dublin and Springfield Townships, many in the Fort Washington Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In Upper Milford Township, a man was rescued after being sucked into an over flow pipe.  In Lower Providence Township, a 13-year-old girl was rescued after falling into Mine Run Creek.   Ninety-two homes were deemed uninhabitable and 538 others were damaged, but uninhabitable.  Ninety-one businesses and 461 apartments were damaged.  Hardest hit in the county was Lower Moreland Township.  About 100 apartment units in the Huntingdon Valley Condominiums were flooded and contaminated by raw sewage, heating oil and gasoline.  All first floor units lost their possessions.  The second hardest hit area was along the Schuylkill River from Upper Providence Township south to Conshohocken.  In Upper Providence Township, flooding reached the first floor in Port Providence. Numerous trees were knocked down throughout the county and damaged several vehicles. In Chester County, severe and record breaking flooding was reported along the branches and main stem of the Brandywine Creek.  In Modena along the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, twenty households were evacuated, the first evacuations 31 years.  Along the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek, a small residential community was leveled in East Bradford Township with losses reaching 90 percent.  The flood stage was about 1 foot higher than occurred with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Gibson's Covered Bridge was severely damaged as trees smashed into hits roof.  Farther upstream in Downingtown, twenty homes were severely damaged as fuel oil leaked from their tanks in flooded basements.  Fifty other homes were severely damaged and hundreds others had minimal damage.  In Phoenixville, thirty people were rescued or evacuated near the Schuylkill River.  Severe flooding closed sections of Pennsylvania State Route 100 and United States Routes 1 and 30, especially near the Valley and Brandywine Creeks.  Chester County was hit the hardest in the Philadelphia area with respect to wind damage.  Houses were damaged by fallen trees in Kenneth Square, Oxford and West Bradford Townships.  A PECO linesman was injured after a tree fell on his ladder.  Both the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek at Downingtown and the main stem Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford (Delaware/Chester county line) had record crests, the previous record occurred during Hurricane Agnes in June of 1972.  Chester and Delaware Counties bore the brunt of the 412,000 outages in PECO Energy's service area.    In Philadelphia, the worst flooding occurred along Cobbs Creek along the Philadelphia/Delaware County border.  About 1,000 people were evacuated and 3,500 homes were flooded.  Jet skis were used to rescue people.  In Manayunk, flooding along the Schuylkill River covered Main Street.  Many basements were flooded and one worker was rescued from a flooded basement.  Four hundred people were stranded at the Radisson Hotel near the Philadelphia International Airport. Some foundations were undermined in the city's Roxborough section.  Numerous trees were knocked down, several damaged vehicles around the University of Pennsylvania.  Tidal flooding along the Delaware River also caused some moderate flooding in low lying areas on the river around 7 p.m. EDT.In Berks County, the effects of Floyd relatively speaking diminished.  Nevertheless, numerous creeks and the Schuylkill River flooded. Many basements were flooded and numerous roads were closed into the morning of the 17th due to either standing water and/or debris.  About 15 people were evacuated along the Allegheny (Robeson Township) and Sacony (Kutztown Borough) Creeks.  Flooding along the Stony Creek forced the evacuation of a high school at 11 a.m. EDT.  Flooding was also reported along the Hay and Monocacy Creeks.  Water rescues were performed in Exeter and Longswamp Townships. About 31,500 homes and businesses lost power in the county due to downed trees and wires.  Power was totally restored on the 20th.  In the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos the winds of Floyd were as much of a problem as were the heavy rains.  Numerous trees were knocked down.  In Northampton County, there were over 100 calls for removal of downed trees.  Downed trees closed U.S. Route 209 in Carbon County.  GPU Energy reported 16,325 homes and businesses lost power in the Lehigh Valley and all power was restored on the 17th. PPL reported 41,000 homes and businesses lost power in their Eastern Pennsylvania service area.  The heavy rain pushed numerous streams over bankfull.  The Bushkill (Northampton County), Cedar (Lehigh County), Jordan (Lehigh County), Little Lehigh (Lehigh County), Monocacy (Lehigh County), Saucon (Lehigh County) and Trout (Monroe and Lehigh County) Creeks all flooded.  Flooding and road closures were reported along U.S Route 22 and Pennsylvania State Routes 309,313,512 and 611. Numerous basements were flooded and several smaller roads were washed out.  A mudslide closed Pennsylvania State Route 611 in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area. The city of Allentown stopped drawing water from the Little Lehigh Creek because it was becoming contaminated with dirt and other substances.  People were rescued from trapped cars in both Lower Macungie (Lehigh County) and Lower Saucon (Northampton County) Townships.

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around six inches in the Poconos and Berks County,  eight inches in the Lehigh Valley and from eight to twelve inches in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.  Six people died directly from the hurricane - four drownings and two persons were hit by trees.  The hurricane also indirectly contributed to the death of about seven other persons.  About 40 persons were seriously injured. There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About  7,000 persons were evacuated, more than half were from Delaware and Bucks Counties, the two hardest hit counties in the state.  The Preliminary damage estimate was 60 million dollars. Damage to infrastructure was around 20 million dollars and hundreds of roads and dozens of bridges were damaged or closed.  A couple of bridges in Bucks County are not expected to be reopened until 2001. About 200 houses were seriously damaged or destroyed, another 1,000 were damaged but still inhabitable.  Over 10,000 homes were flooded.  Over 500 apartments were also damaged as were over 100 businesses. The flooding affected fourteen key regional rail service lines around Philadelphia, many were closed and/or damaged. About 501,000 homes and businesses lost power - 412,000 in the PECO Service area in Southeast Pennsylvania, the second worst outage in the company's history.   School children were dismissed early. Sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers. The first directly related hurricane death occurred in East Nottingham Township in Chester County.  A 53-year-old woman was crushed when a tree fell through her house.  In Montgomery County three persons drowned in their vehicles when they attempted to drive across flooded roadways.  One drove around barricades.  A 49-year-old male was found inside his vehicle in the Perkiomen Creek in Perkiomen Valley Park.  His disabled vehicle apparently was swept into the creek.  A 73-year-old woman was found inside her vehicle in the Wissahickon Creek in Whitemarsh Township.  Her vehicle was swept off the road and became pinned against a tree along the banks of the creek.  A 47-year-old man in West Conshohocken drowned after he drove around barricades and became stuck in flood waters.  His father who was a passenger in the car escaped.  In Delaware County, a 67-year-old man drowned in Darby Borough while delivering pizzas.  His van was caught in the swirling waters of the Darby Creek.  In Philadelphia, a 48-year-old man was crushed by a fallen tree as he was waiting for a green light in Fairmount Park.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd contributed to the death of a family (3 persons) on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Chester County and a 44 year-old man in Upper Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County.  Two other men in Montgomery County (a 61-year-old and a 51-year-old) suffered heart attacks and died while trying to remove water from his basement and while being evacuated.  A third (67-year-old) man died of a heart attack in Chester County (West Whiteland Township) while trying to push his vehicle from flood waters on Pennsylvania State Route 100.   The highest verifiable storm total was 12.13 inches in Marcus Hook (Delaware County).  Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest precipitation coincided near the ""fall line"" in Southeast Pennsylvania.  The fall line is the boundary between the coastal plain and the Piedmont and represents the first significant rise of the land from near sea level.  The onshore flow being lifted over this geographic feature dumped the heaviest rain around this area and fell across northern Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and Lower Montgomery and Bucks Counties.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in locations in and around the ""fall line"" and several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crests on record.  The combination of winds funneling up Delaware Bay and the river and the record runoff from inland waterways produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Delaware, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties.   Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees. Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Berks County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved westward, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category (Major) IV Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was also a very large in size hurricane that would prolong the extent of both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward along the fall line and dropped the heaviest rain near this geographic feature.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 5 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into the Poconos by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain crossed the Mason/Dixon Line. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state.   But the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Floyd hit Bucks County the hardest, especially in the Neshaminy Creek Basin.  The Neshaminy Creek had its second highest crest on record only surpassed by Hurricanes Connie and Diane in 1955.  About 2,000 people were evacuated and numerous rescues occurred.  In Buckingham Township, 11 school children and the bus driver were rescued after being stranded in the Mill Creek.   Twenty-nine homes were destroyed, 80 other were damaged or uninhabitable and 304 others were damaged but still inhabitable.  Thirty-two businesses were damaged or destroyed, twelve public buildings or pieces of equipment were destroyed and eighteen public parks were damaged.  Flooding was extensive along the Neshaminy Basin from Warrington Township to Bristol Township.  In Middletown Township homes along Bridle Drive and Periwinkle Avenue were severely flooded.  One house was swept 10 feet off its foundation.  Several underground heating oil tanks erupted.  In Northampton Township, every bridge over the Neshaminy Creek was closed.  Many cars became stranded after driving around barricades.  Persons were rescued from car tops.  The Langhorne Players Building was destroyed. In Warrington Township five homes along the Little Neshaminy Creek were deemed uninhabitable. The second hard hit area was in townships along the Delaware River as the evening high tide slowed the discharge of streams into the river.  Evacuations occurred along the Delaware River in Yardley and Lower Makefield Township, two people were rescued from 10 feet of water.  Elsewhere in the county, flooding along the East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek forced the evacuation of downtown Sellersville.  In Upper Southampton Township, two homes collapsed because of the heavy rain.   Nearly every creek and even some lakes (Silver Lake in Bristol Borough) overflowed. High winds also took their toll.  A Perkasie woman was injured trying to remove a downed tree.  A fallen tree severely damaged a house in Falls Township.  The SEPTA Regional rail service to trenton was stopped because of downed trees on the tracks. Seventy roads were closed and included long stretches of Pennsylvania State Route 611. Seven roads were too damaged to be reopened in Buckingham, Lower Makefield and Upper Makefield Townships.  They were still closed on the 25th.  Pennsylvania State Route 32 in Solebury Township was expected to be closed indefinitely.  Bridges were damaged or washed out in Buckingham, Durham, Solebury, Upper Makefield and Wrightstown Townships. Three bridges were destroyed and were not expected to be reopened until 2001.  They are River Road (Pennsylvania State Route 32) over the Jericho Creek in Upper Makefield Township, New Hope Road over the Mill Creek in Buckingham Townships and Swamp Road over the Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township.  Delaware County was the second hardest hit county in the state, but no location was hit harder than Darby Borough as flooding along the Darby and Cobb Creeks cut off and decimated the borough.  Seven hundred people were evacuated, one hundred were rescued by boat, 11 were plucked from flood waters. The creek devoured residents and businesses along Mill and Walnut Streets. Twenty-five businesses were in ruin; a bank and liquor store disappeared under eight feet of flood water. A delivery van floated into six 2,000 gallon tanks containing toxic solvents, four were recovered.  An ice machine was recovered half a mile downstream.  The Colwyn section of Lansdowne Borough was also hard hit  by the Darby Creek flooding.  During the evening of the 16th about 1,000 persons were evacuated in the Crum Creek Valley in Marple, Media, Nether Providence, Ridley, Swarthmore, and Upper Providence Townships.  Officials feared the record rainfall would damage the Springton Reservoir Dam's spillway.  Other evacuations occurred along the Chester Creek in Aston, Brookhaven, Chester City and Upland Borough.  The Chester Creek in Chester had its second highest crest on record since 1971. Tidal flooding also forced the evacuation of about 500 people along the Delaware River in Marcus Hook.  Flooding forced evacuations along the Marcus Hook in Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough. Intense flooding along Pennsylvania State Route 291 forced the evacuation of 200 people in Tinicum Township. Numerous roads were closed and several were damaged.  Two were still closed on the 21st. Numerous water rescues occurred. A Lansdowne firefighter was injured while trying to rescue several children stuck in a tree. A 58-year-old woman was injured when she inadvertently lit an M80 instead of a candle. Mud reached three to four feet high in the business district of Aston Township.  The high winds downed numerous trees across the county.  One tree damaged a home in Media Borough.   Delaware and Chester Counties bore the brunt of the power outages in PECO Energy's service area.   In Montgomery County, about 1,500 persons were evacuated.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas of Abington, Collegeville, Conshohocken, Lower Moreland, Upper Dublin, Upper Moreland and West Norriton Townships.   In Upper Dublin Township, 100 residents and 65 children were evacuated after water overflowed the top of the Loch Alsh Reservoir. Numerous water rescues occurred, some from car tops. In Conshohocken, a regional rail car became surrounded by 6 feet of flood waters from the Plymouth Creek quickly. Ten people were trapped.  A rescue boat sent capsized and several passengers clung to a tree for a couple of hours before finally being rescued.  About 75 persons were rescued from flood waters in Upper Dublin and Springfield Townships, many in the Fort Washington Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In Upper Milford Township, a man was rescued after being sucked into an over flow pipe.  In Lower Providence Township, a 13-year-old girl was rescued after falling into Mine Run Creek.   Ninety-two homes were deemed uninhabitable and 538 others were damaged, but uninhabitable.  Ninety-one businesses and 461 apartments were damaged.  Hardest hit in the county was Lower Moreland Township.  About 100 apartment units in the Huntingdon Valley Condominiums were flooded and contaminated by raw sewage, heating oil and gasoline.  All first floor units lost their possessions.  The second hardest hit area was along the Schuylkill River from Upper Providence Township south to Conshohocken.  In Upper Providence Township, flooding reached the first floor in Port Providence. Numerous trees were knocked down throughout the county and damaged several vehicles. In Chester County, severe and record breaking flooding was reported along the branches and main stem of the Brandywine Creek.  In Modena along the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, twenty households were evacuated, the first evacuations 31 years.  Along the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek, a small residential community was leveled in East Bradford Township with losses reaching 90 percent.  The flood stage was about 1 foot higher than occurred with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Gibson's Covered Bridge was severely damaged as trees smashed into hits roof.  Farther upstream in Downingtown, twenty homes were severely damaged as fuel oil leaked from their tanks in flooded basements.  Fifty other homes were severely damaged and hundreds others had minimal damage.  In Phoenixville, thirty people were rescued or evacuated near the Schuylkill River.  Severe flooding closed sections of Pennsylvania State Route 100 and United States Routes 1 and 30, especially near the Valley and Brandywine Creeks.  Chester County was hit the hardest in the Philadelphia area with respect to wind damage.  Houses were damaged by fallen trees in Kenneth Square, Oxford and West Bradford Townships.  A PECO linesman was injured after a tree fell on his ladder.  Both the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek at Downingtown and the main stem Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford (Delaware/Chester county line) had record crests, the previous record occurred during Hurricane Agnes in June of 1972.

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around six inches in the Poconos and Berks County,  eight inches in the Lehigh Valley and from eight to twelve inches in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.  Six people died directly from the hurricane - four drownings and two persons were hit by trees.  The hurricane also indirectly contributed to the death of about seven other persons.  About 40 persons were seriously injured. There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About  7,000 persons were evacuated, more than half were from Delaware and Bucks Counties, the two hardest hit counties in the state.  The Preliminary damage estimate was 60 million dollars. Damage to infrastructure was around 20 million dollars and hundreds of roads and dozens of bridges were damaged or closed.  A couple of bridges in Bucks County are not expected to be reopened until 2001. About 200 houses were seriously damaged or destroyed, another 1,000 were damaged but still inhabitable.  Over 10,000 homes were flooded.  Over 500 apartments were also damaged as were over 100 businesses. The flooding affected fourteen key regional rail service lines around Philadelphia, many were closed and/or damaged. About 501,000 homes and businesses lost power - 412,000 in the PECO Service area in Southeast Pennsylvania, the second worst outage in the company's history.   School children were dismissed early. Sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers. The first directly related hurricane death occurred in East Nottingham Township in Chester County.  A 53-year-old woman was crushed when a tree fell through her house.  In Montgomery County three persons drowned in their vehicles when they attempted to drive across flooded roadways.  One drove around barricades.  A 49-year-old male was found inside his vehicle in the Perkiomen Creek in Perkiomen Valley Park.  His disabled vehicle apparently was swept into the creek.  A 73-year-old woman was found inside her vehicle in the Wissahickon Creek in Whitemarsh Township.  Her vehicle was swept off the road and became pinned against a tree along the banks of the creek.  A 47-year-old man in West Conshohocken drowned after he drove around barricades and became stuck in flood waters.  His father who was a passenger in the car escaped.  In Delaware County, a 67-year-old man drowned in Darby Borough while delivering pizzas.  His van was caught in the swirling waters of the Darby Creek.  In Philadelphia, a 48-year-old man was crushed by a fallen tree as he was waiting for a green light in Fairmount Park.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd contributed to the death of a family (3 persons) on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Chester County and a 44 year-old man in Upper Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County.  Two other men in Montgomery County (a 61-year-old and a 51-year-old) suffered heart attacks and died while trying to remove water from his basement and while being evacuated.  A third (67-year-old) man died of a heart attack in Chester County (West Whiteland Township) while trying to push his vehicle from flood waters on Pennsylvania State Route 100.   The highest verifiable storm total was 12.13 inches in Marcus Hook (Delaware County).  Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest precipitation coincided near the ""fall line"" in Southeast Pennsylvania.  The fall line is the boundary between the coastal plain and the Piedmont and represents the first significant rise of the land from near sea level.  The onshore flow being lifted over this geographic feature dumped the heaviest rain around this area and fell across northern Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and Lower Montgomery and Bucks Counties.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in locations in and around the ""fall line"" and several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crests on record.  The combination of winds funneling up Delaware Bay and the river and the record runoff from inland waterways produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Delaware, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties.   Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees. Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Berks County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved westward, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category (Major) IV Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was also a very large in size hurricane that would prolong the extent of both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward along the fall line and dropped the heaviest rain near this geographic feature.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 5 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into the Poconos by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain crossed the Mason/Dixon Line. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state.   But the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Floyd hit Bucks County the hardest, especially in the Neshaminy Creek Basin.  The Neshaminy Creek had its second highest crest on record only surpassed by Hurricanes Connie and Diane in 1955.  About 2,000 people were evacuated and numerous rescues occurred.  In Buckingham Township, 11 school children and the bus driver were rescued after being stranded in the Mill Creek.   Twenty-nine homes were destroyed, 80 other were damaged or uninhabitable and 304 others were damaged but still inhabitable.  Thirty-two businesses were damaged or destroyed, twelve public buildings or pieces of equipment were destroyed and eighteen public parks were damaged.  Flooding was extensive along the Neshaminy Basin from Warrington Township to Bristol Township.  In Middletown Township homes along Bridle Drive and Periwinkle Avenue were severely flooded.  One house was swept 10 feet off its foundation.  Several underground heating oil tanks erupted.  In Northampton Township, every bridge over the Neshaminy Creek was closed.  Many cars became stranded after driving around barricades.  Persons were rescued from car tops.  The Langhorne Players Building was destroyed. In Warrington Township five homes along the Little Neshaminy Creek were deemed uninhabitable. The second hard hit area was in townships along the Delaware River as the evening high tide slowed the discharge of streams into the river.  Evacuations occurred along the Delaware River in Yardley and Lower Makefield Township, two people were rescued from 10 feet of water.  Elsewhere in the county, flooding along the East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek forced the evacuation of downtown Sellersville.  In Upper Southampton Township, two homes collapsed because of the heavy rain.   Nearly every creek and even some lakes (Silver Lake in Bristol Borough) overflowed. High winds also took their toll.  A Perkasie woman was injured trying to remove a downed tree.  A fallen tree severely damaged a house in Falls Township.  The SEPTA Regional rail service to trenton was stopped because of downed trees on the tracks. Seventy roads were closed and included long stretches of Pennsylvania State Route 611. Seven roads were too damaged to be reopened in Buckingham, Lower Makefield and Upper Makefield Townships.  They were still closed on the 25th.  Pennsylvania State Route 32 in Solebury Township was expected to be closed indefinitely.  Bridges were damaged or washed out in Buckingham, Durham, Solebury, Upper Makefield and Wrightstown Townships. Three bridges were destroyed and were not expected to be reopened until 2001.  They are River Road (Pennsylvania State Route 32) over the Jericho Creek in Upper Makefield Township, New Hope Road over the Mill Creek in Buckingham Townships and Swamp Road over the Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township.  Delaware County was the second hardest hit county in the state, but no location was hit harder than Darby Borough as flooding along the Darby and Cobb Creeks cut off and decimated the borough.  Seven hundred people were evacuated, one hundred were rescued by boat, 11 were plucked from flood waters. The creek devoured residents and businesses along Mill and Walnut Streets. Twenty-five businesses were in ruin; a bank and liquor store disappeared under eight feet of flood water. A delivery van floated into six 2,000 gallon tanks containing toxic solvents, four were recovered.  An ice machine was recovered half a mile downstream.  The Colwyn section of Lansdowne Borough was also hard hit  by the Darby Creek flooding.  During the evening of the 16th about 1,000 persons were evacuated in the Crum Creek Valley in Marple, Media, Nether Providence, Ridley, Swarthmore, and Upper Providence Townships.  Officials feared the record rainfall would damage the Springton Reservoir Dam's spillway.  Other evacuations occurred along the Chester Creek in Aston, Brookhaven, Chester City and Upland Borough.  The Chester Creek in Chester had its second highest crest on record since 1971. Tidal flooding also forced the evacuation of about 500 people along the Delaware River in Marcus Hook.  Flooding forced evacuations along the Marcus Hook in Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough. Intense flooding along Pennsylvania State Route 291 forced the evacuation of 200 people in Tinicum Township. Numerous roads were closed and several were damaged.  Two were still closed on the 21st. Numerous water rescues occurred. A Lansdowne firefighter was injured while trying to rescue several children stuck in a tree. A 58-year-old woman was injured when she inadvertently lit an M80 instead of a candle. Mud reached three to four feet high in the business district of Aston Township.  The high winds downed numerous trees across the county.  One tree damaged a home in Media Borough.   Delaware and Chester Counties bore the brunt of the power outages in PECO Energy's service area.   In Montgomery County, about 1,500 persons were evacuated.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas of Abington, Collegeville, Conshohocken, Lower Moreland, Upper Dublin, Upper Moreland and West Norriton Townships.   In Upper Dublin Township, 100 residents and 65 children were evacuated after water overflowed the top of the Loch Alsh Reservoir. Numerous water rescues occurred, some from car tops. In Conshohocken, a regional rail car became surrounded by 6 feet of flood waters from the Plymouth Creek quickly. Ten people were trapped.  A rescue boat sent capsized and several passengers clung to a tree for a couple of hours before finally being rescued.  About 75 persons were rescued from flood waters in Upper Dublin and Springfield Townships, many in the Fort Washington Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In Upper Milford Township, a man was rescued after being sucked into an over flow pipe.  In Lower Providence Township, a 13-year-old girl was rescued after falling into Mine Run Creek.   Ninety-two homes were deemed uninhabitable and 538 others were damaged, but uninhabitable.  Ninety-one businesses and 461 apartments were damaged.  Hardest hit in the county was Lower Moreland Township.  About 100 apartment units in the Huntingdon Valley Condominiums were flooded and contaminated by raw sewage, heating oil and gasoline.  All first floor units lost their possessions.  The second hardest hit area was along the Schuylkill River from Upper Providence Township south to Conshohocken.  In Upper Providence Township, flooding reached the first floor in Port Providence. Numerous trees were knocked down throughout the county and damaged several vehicles. In Chester County, severe and record breaking flooding was reported along the branches and main stem of the Brandywine Creek.  In Modena along the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, twenty households were evacuated, the first evacuations 31 years.  Along the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek, a small residential community was leveled in East Bradford Township with losses reaching 90 percent.  The flood stage was about 1 foot higher than occurred with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Gibson's Covered Bridge was severely damaged as trees smashed into hits roof.  Farther upstream in Downingtown, twenty homes were severely damaged as fuel oil leaked from their tanks in flooded basements.  Fifty other homes were severely damaged and hundreds others had minimal damage.  In Phoenixville, thirty people were rescued or evacuated near the Schuylkill River.  Severe flooding closed sections of Pennsylvania State Route 100 and United States Routes 1 and 30, especially near the Valley and Brandywine Creeks.  Chester County was hit the hardest in the Philadelphia area with respect to wind damage.  Houses were damaged by fallen trees in Kenneth Square, Oxford and West Bradford Townships.  A PECO linesman was injured after a tree fell on his ladder.  Both the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek at Downingtown and the main stem Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford (Delaware/Chester county line) had record crests, the previous record occurred during Hurricane Agnes in June of 1972.  Chester and Delaware Counties bore the brunt of the 412,000 outages in PECO Energy's service area.    In Philadelphia, the worst flooding occurred along Cobbs Creek along the Philadelphia/Delaware County border.  About 1,000 people were evacuated and 3,500 homes were flooded.  Jet skis were used to rescue people.  In Manayunk, flooding along the Schuylkill River covered Main Street.  Many basements were flooded and one worker was rescued from a flooded basement.  Four hundred people were stranded at the Radisson Hotel near the Philadelphia International Airport. Some foundations were undermined in the city's Roxborough section.  Numerous trees were knocked down, several damaged vehicles around the University of Pennsylvania.  Tidal flooding along the Delaware River also caused some moderate flooding in low lying areas on the river around 7 p.m. EDT.In Berks County, the effects of Floyd relatively speaking diminished.  Nevertheless, numerous creeks and the Schuylkill River flooded. Many basements were flooded and numerous roads were closed into the morning of the 17th due to either standing water and/or debris.  About 15 people were evacuated along the Allegheny (Robeson Township) and Sacony (Kutztown Borough) Creeks.  Flooding along the Stony Creek forced the evacuation of a high school at 11 a.m. EDT.  Flooding was also reported along the Hay and Monocacy Creeks.  Water rescues were performed in Exeter and Longswamp Townships. About 31,500 homes and businesses lost power in the county due to downed trees and wires.  Power was totally restored on the 20th.  In the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos the winds of Floyd were as much of a problem as were the heavy rains.  Numerous trees were knocked down.  In Northampton County, there were over 100 calls for removal of downed trees.  Downed trees closed U.S. Route 209 in Carbon County.  GPU Energy reported 16,325 homes and businesses lost power in the Lehigh Valley and all power was restored on the 17th. PPL reported 41,000 homes and businesses lost power in their Eastern Pennsylvania service area.  The heavy rain pushed numerous streams over bankfull.  The Bushkill (Northampton County), Cedar (Lehigh County), Jordan (Lehigh County), Little Lehigh (Lehigh County), Monocacy (Lehigh County), Saucon (Lehigh County) and Trout (Monroe and Lehigh County) Creeks all flooded.  Flooding and road closures were reported along U.S Route 22 and Pennsylvania State Routes 309,313,512 and 611. Numerous basements were flooded and several smaller roads were washed out.  A mudslide closed Pennsylvania State Route 611 in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area. The city of Allentown stopped drawing water from the Little Lehigh Creek because it was becoming contaminated with dirt and other substances.  People were rescued from trapped cars in both Lower Macungie (Lehigh County) and Lower Saucon (Northampton County) Townships.

Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Berks County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved westward, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category (Major) IV Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was also a very large in size hurricane that would prolong the extent of both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward along the fall line and dropped the heaviest rain near this geographic feature.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 5 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into the Poconos by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain crossed the Mason/Dixon Line. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state.   But the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Floyd hit Bucks County the hardest, especially in the Neshaminy Creek Basin.  The Neshaminy Creek had its second highest crest on record only surpassed by Hurricanes Connie and Diane in 1955.  About 2,000 people were evacuated and numerous rescues occurred.  In Buckingham Township, 11 school children and the bus driver were rescued after being stranded in the Mill Creek.   Twenty-nine homes were destroyed, 80 other were damaged or uninhabitable and 304 others were damaged but still inhabitable.  Thirty-two businesses were damaged or destroyed, twelve public buildings or pieces of equipment were destroyed and eighteen public parks were damaged.  Flooding was extensive along the Neshaminy Basin from Warrington Township to Bristol Township.  In Middletown Township homes along Bridle Drive and Periwinkle Avenue were severely flooded.  One house was swept 10 feet off its foundation.  Several underground heating oil tanks erupted.  In Northampton Township, every bridge over the Neshaminy Creek was closed.  Many cars became stranded after driving around barricades.  Persons were rescued from car tops.  The Langhorne Players Building was destroyed. In Warrington Township five homes along the Little Neshaminy Creek were deemed uninhabitable. The second hard hit area was in townships along the Delaware River as the evening high tide slowed the discharge of streams into the river.  Evacuations occurred along the Delaware River in Yardley and Lower Makefield Township, two people were rescued from 10 feet of water.  Elsewhere in the county, flooding along the East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek forced the evacuation of downtown Sellersville.  In Upper Southampton Township, two homes collapsed because of the heavy rain.   Nearly every creek and even some lakes (Silver Lake in Bristol Borough) overflowed. High winds also took their toll.  A Perkasie woman was injured trying to remove a downed tree.  A fallen tree severely damaged a house in Falls Township.  The SEPTA Regional rail service to trenton was stopped because of downed trees on the tracks. Seventy roads were closed and included long stretches of Pennsylvania State Route 611. Seven roads were too damaged to be reopened in Buckingham, Lower Makefield and Upper Makefield Townships.  They were still closed on the 25th.  Pennsylvania State Route 32 in Solebury Township was expected to be closed indefinitely.  Bridges were damaged or washed out in Buckingham, Durham, Solebury, Upper Makefield and Wrightstown Townships. Three bridges were destroyed and were not expected to be reopened until 2001.  They are River Road (Pennsylvania State Route 32) over the Jericho Creek in Upper Makefield Township, New Hope Road over the Mill Creek in Buckingham Townships and Swamp Road over the Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township.  Delaware County was the second hardest hit county in the state, but no location was hit harder than Darby Borough as flooding along the Darby and Cobb Creeks cut off and decimated the borough.  Seven hundred people were evacuated, one hundred were rescued by boat, 11 were plucked from flood waters. The creek devoured residents and businesses along Mill and Walnut Streets. Twenty-five businesses were in ruin; a bank and liquor store disappeared under eight feet of flood water. A delivery van floated into six 2,000 gallon tanks containing toxic solvents, four were recovered.  An ice machine was recovered half a mile downstream.  The Colwyn section of Lansdowne Borough was also hard hit  by the Darby Creek flooding.  During the evening of the 16th about 1,000 persons were evacuated in the Crum Creek Valley in Marple, Media, Nether Providence, Ridley, Swarthmore, and Upper Providence Townships.  Officials feared the record rainfall would damage the Springton Reservoir Dam's spillway.  Other evacuations occurred along the Chester Creek in Aston, Brookhaven, Chester City and Upland Borough.  The Chester Creek in Chester had its second highest crest on record since 1971. Tidal flooding also forced the evacuation of about 500 people along the Delaware River in Marcus Hook.  Flooding forced evacuations along the Marcus Hook in Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough. Intense flooding along Pennsylvania State Route 291 forced the evacuation of 200 people in Tinicum Township. Numerous roads were closed and several were damaged.  Two were still closed on the 21st. Numerous water rescues occurred. A Lansdowne firefighter was injured while trying to rescue several children stuck in a tree. A 58-year-old woman was injured when she inadvertently lit an M80 instead of a candle. Mud reached three to four feet high in the business district of Aston Township.  The high winds downed numerous trees across the county.  One tree damaged a home in Media Borough.   Delaware and Chester Counties bore the brunt of the power outages in PECO Energy's service area.   In Montgomery County, about 1,500 persons were evacuated.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas of Abington, Collegeville, Conshohocken, Lower Moreland, Upper Dublin, Upper Moreland and West Norriton Townships.   In Upper Dublin Township, 100 residents and 65 children were evacuated after water overflowed the top of the Loch Alsh Reservoir. Numerous water rescues occurred, some from car tops. In Conshohocken, a regional rail car became surrounded by 6 feet of flood waters from the Plymouth Creek quickly. Ten people were trapped.  A rescue boat sent capsized and several passengers clung to a tree for a couple of hours before finally being rescued.  About 75 persons were rescued from flood waters in Upper Dublin and Springfield Townships, many in the Fort Washington Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In Upper Milford Township, a man was rescued after being sucked into an over flow pipe.  In Lower Providence Township, a 13-year-old girl was rescued after falling into Mine Run Creek.   Ninety-two homes were deemed uninhabitable and 538 others were damaged, but uninhabitable.  Ninety-one businesses and 461 apartments were damaged.  Hardest hit in the county was Lower Moreland Township.  About 100 apartment units in the Huntingdon Valley Condominiums were flooded and contaminated by raw sewage, heating oil and gasoline.  All first floor units lost their possessions.  The second hardest hit area was along the Schuylkill River from Upper Providence Township south to Conshohocken.  In Upper Providence Township, flooding reached the first floor in Port Providence. Numerous trees were knocked down throughout the county and damaged several vehicles. In Chester County, severe and record breaking flooding was reported along the branches and main stem of the Brandywine Creek.  In Modena along the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, twenty households were evacuated, the first evacuations 31 years.  Along the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek, a small residential community was leveled in East Bradford Township with losses reaching 90 percent.  The flood stage was about 1 foot higher than occurred with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Gibson's Covered Bridge was severely damaged as trees smashed into hits roof.  Farther upstream in Downingtown, twenty homes were severely damaged as fuel oil leaked from their tanks in flooded basements.  Fifty other homes were severely damaged and hundreds others had minimal damage.  In Phoenixville, thirty people were rescued or evacuated near the Schuylkill River.  Severe flooding closed sections of Pennsylvania State Route 100 and United States Routes 1 and 30, especially near the Valley and Brandywine Creeks.  Chester County was hit the hardest in the Philadelphia area with respect to wind damage.  Houses were damaged by fallen trees in Kenneth Square, Oxford and West Bradford Townships.  A PECO linesman was injured after a tree fell on his ladder.  Both the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek at Downingtown and the main stem Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford (Delaware/Chester county line) had record crests, the previous record occurred during Hurricane Agnes in June of 1972.  Chester and Delaware Counties bore the brunt of the 412,000 outages in PECO Energy's service area.    In Philadelphia, the worst flooding occurred along Cobbs Creek along the Philadelphia/Delaware County border.  About 1,000 people were evacuated and 3,500 homes were flooded.  Jet skis were used to rescue people.  In Manayunk, flooding along the Schuylkill River covered Main Street.  Many basements were flooded and one worker was rescued from a flooded basement.  Four hundred people were stranded at the Radisson Hotel near the Philadelphia International Airport. Some foundations were undermined in the city's Roxborough section.  Numerous trees were knocked down, several damaged vehicles around the University of Pennsylvania.  Tidal flooding along the Delaware River also caused some moderate flooding in low lying areas on the river around 7 p.m. EDT.In Berks County, the effects of Floyd relatively speaking diminished.  Nevertheless, numerous creeks and the Schuylkill River flooded. Many basements were flooded and numerous roads were closed into the morning of the 17th due to either standing water and/or debris.  About 15 people were evacuated along the Allegheny (Robeson Township) and Sacony (Kutztown Borough) Creeks.  Flooding along the Stony Creek forced the evacuation of a high school at 11 a.m. EDT.  Flooding was also reported along the Hay and Monocacy Creeks.  Water rescues were performed in Exeter and Longswamp Townships. About 31,500 homes and businesses lost power in the county due to downed trees and wires.  Power was totally restored on the 20th.  In the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos the winds of Floyd were as much of a problem as were the heavy rains.  Numerous trees were knocked down.  In Northampton County, there were over 100 calls for removal of downed trees.  Downed trees closed U.S. Route 209 in Carbon County.  GPU Energy reported 16,325 homes and businesses lost power in the Lehigh Valley and all power was restored on the 17th. PPL reported 41,000 homes and businesses lost power in their Eastern Pennsylvania service area.  The heavy rain pushed numerous streams over bankfull.  The Bushkill (Northampton County), Cedar (Lehigh County), Jordan (Lehigh County), Little Lehigh (Lehigh County), Monocacy (Lehigh County), Saucon (Lehigh County) and Trout (Monroe and Lehigh County) Creeks all flooded.  Flooding and road closures were reported along U.S Route 22 and Pennsylvania State Routes 309,313,512 and 611. Numerous basements were flooded and several smaller roads were washed out.  A mudslide closed Pennsylvania State Route 611 in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area. The city of Allentown stopped drawing water from the Little Lehigh Creek because it was becoming contaminated with dirt and other substances.  People were rescued from trapped cars in both Lower Macungie (Lehigh County) and Lower Saucon (Northampton County) Townships.

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around six inches in the Poconos and Berks County,  eight inches in the Lehigh Valley and from eight to twelve inches in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.  Six people died directly from the hurricane - four drownings and two persons were hit by trees.  The hurricane also indirectly contributed to the death of about seven other persons.  About 40 persons were seriously injured. There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About  7,000 persons were evacuated, more than half were from Delaware and Bucks Counties, the two hardest hit counties in the state.  The Preliminary damage estimate was 60 million dollars. Damage to infrastructure was around 20 million dollars and hundreds of roads and dozens of bridges were damaged or closed.  A couple of bridges in Bucks County are not expected to be reopened until 2001. About 200 houses were seriously damaged or destroyed, another 1,000 were damaged but still inhabitable.  Over 10,000 homes were flooded.  Over 500 apartments were also damaged as were over 100 businesses. The flooding affected fourteen key regional rail service lines around Philadelphia, many were closed and/or damaged. About 501,000 homes and businesses lost power - 412,000 in the PECO Service area in Southeast Pennsylvania, the second worst outage in the company's history.   School children were dismissed early. Sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers. The first directly related hurricane death occurred in East Nottingham Township in Chester County.  A 53-year-old woman was crushed when a tree fell through her house.  In Montgomery County three persons drowned in their vehicles when they attempted to drive across flooded roadways.  One drove around barricades.  A 49-year-old male was found inside his vehicle in the Perkiomen Creek in Perkiomen Valley Park.  His disabled vehicle apparently was swept into the creek.  A 73-year-old woman was found inside her vehicle in the Wissahickon Creek in Whitemarsh Township.  Her vehicle was swept off the road and became pinned against a tree along the banks of the creek.  A 47-year-old man in West Conshohocken drowned after he drove around barricades and became stuck in flood waters.  His father who was a passenger in the car escaped.  In Delaware County, a 67-year-old man drowned in Darby Borough while delivering pizzas.  His van was caught in the swirling waters of the Darby Creek.  In Philadelphia, a 48-year-old man was crushed by a fallen tree as he was waiting for a green light in Fairmount Park.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd contributed to the death of a family (3 persons) on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Chester County and a 44 year-old man in Upper Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County.  Two other men in Montgomery County (a 61-year-old and a 51-year-old) suffered heart attacks and died while trying to remove water from his basement and while being evacuated.  A third (67-year-old) man died of a heart attack in Chester County (West Whiteland Township) while trying to push his vehicle from flood waters on Pennsylvania State Route 100.   The highest verifiable storm total was 12.13 inches in Marcus Hook (Delaware County).  Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest precipitation coincided near the ""fall line"" in Southeast Pennsylvania.  The fall line is the boundary between the coastal plain and the Piedmont and represents the first significant rise of the land from near sea level.  The onshore flow being lifted over this geographic feature dumped the heaviest rain around this area and fell across northern Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and Lower Montgomery and Bucks Counties.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in locations in and around the ""fall line"" and several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crests on record.  The combination of winds funneling up Delaware Bay and the river and the record runoff from inland waterways produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Delaware, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties.   Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees. Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.

Four hundred people were stranded at the Radisson Hotel near the Philadelphia International Airport. Some foundations were undermined in the city's Roxborough section.  Numerous trees were knocked down, several damaged vehicles around the University of Pennsylvania.  Tidal flooding along the Delaware River also caused some moderate flooding in low lying areas on the river around 7 p.m. EDT.In Berks County, the effects of Floyd relatively speaking diminished.  Nevertheless, numerous creeks and the Schuylkill River flooded. Many basements were flooded and numerous roads were closed into the morning of the 17th due to either standing water and/or debris.  About 15 people were evacuated along the Allegheny (Robeson Township) and Sacony (Kutztown Borough) Creeks.  Flooding along the Stony Creek forced the evacuation of a high school at 11 a.m. EDT.  Flooding was also reported along the Hay and Monocacy Creeks.  Water rescues were performed in Exeter and Longswamp Townships. About 31,500 homes and businesses lost power in the county due to downed trees and wires.  Power was totally restored on the 20th.  In the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos the winds of Floyd were as much of a problem as were the heavy rains.  Numerous trees were knocked down.  In Northampton County, there were over 100 calls for removal of downed trees.  Downed trees closed U.S. Route 209 in Carbon County.  GPU Energy reported 16,325 homes and businesses lost power in the Lehigh Valley and all power was restored on the 17th.

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around six inches in the Poconos and Berks County,  eight inches in the Lehigh Valley and from eight to twelve inches in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.  Six people died directly from the hurricane - four drownings and two persons were hit by trees.  The hurricane also indirectly contributed to the death of about seven other persons.  About 40 persons were seriously injured. There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About  7,000 persons were evacuated, more than half were from Delaware and Bucks Counties, the two hardest hit counties in the state.  The Preliminary damage estimate was 60 million dollars. Damage to infrastructure was around 20 million dollars and hundreds of roads and dozens of bridges were damaged or closed.  A couple of bridges in Bucks County are not expected to be reopened until 2001. About 200 houses were seriously damaged or destroyed, another 1,000 were damaged but still inhabitable.  Over 10,000 homes were flooded.  Over 500 apartments were also damaged as were over 100 businesses. The flooding affected fourteen key regional rail service lines around Philadelphia, many were closed and/or damaged. About 501,000 homes and businesses lost power - 412,000 in the PECO Service area in Southeast Pennsylvania, the second worst outage in the company's history.   School children were dismissed early. Sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers. The first directly related hurricane death occurred in East Nottingham Township in Chester County.  A 53-year-old woman was crushed when a tree fell through her house.  In Montgomery County three persons drowned in their vehicles when they attempted to drive across flooded roadways.  One drove around barricades.  A 49-year-old male was found inside his vehicle in the Perkiomen Creek in Perkiomen Valley Park.  His disabled vehicle apparently was swept into the creek.  A 73-year-old woman was found inside her vehicle in the Wissahickon Creek in Whitemarsh Township.  Her vehicle was swept off the road and became pinned against a tree along the banks of the creek.  A 47-year-old man in West Conshohocken drowned after he drove around barricades and became stuck in flood waters.  His father who was a passenger in the car escaped.  In Delaware County, a 67-year-old man drowned in Darby Borough while delivering pizzas.  His van was caught in the swirling waters of the Darby Creek.  In Philadelphia, a 48-year-old man was crushed by a fallen tree as he was waiting for a green light in Fairmount Park.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd contributed to the death of a family (3 persons) on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Chester County and a 44 year-old man in Upper Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County.  Two other men in Montgomery County (a 61-year-old and a 51-year-old) suffered heart attacks and died while trying to remove water from his basement and while being evacuated.  A third (67-year-old) man died of a heart attack in Chester County (West Whiteland Township) while trying to push his vehicle from flood waters on Pennsylvania State Route 100.   The highest verifiable storm total was 12.13 inches in Marcus Hook (Delaware County).  Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest precipitation coincided near the ""fall line"" in Southeast Pennsylvania.  The fall line is the boundary between the coastal plain and the Piedmont and represents the first significant rise of the land from near sea level.  The onshore flow being lifted over this geographic feature dumped the heaviest rain around this area and fell across northern Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and Lower Montgomery and Bucks Counties.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in locations in and around the ""fall line"" and several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crests on record.  The combination of winds funneling up Delaware Bay and the river and the record runoff from inland waterways produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Delaware, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties.   Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees. Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Berks County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved westward, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category (Major) IV Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was also a very large in size hurricane that would prolong the extent of both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward along the fall line and dropped the heaviest rain near this geographic feature.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 5 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into the Poconos by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain crossed the Mason/Dixon Line. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state.   But the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Floyd hit Bucks County the hardest, especially in the Neshaminy Creek Basin.  The Neshaminy Creek had its second highest crest on record only surpassed by Hurricanes Connie and Diane in 1955.  About 2,000 people were evacuated and numerous rescues occurred.  In Buckingham Township, 11 school children and the bus driver were rescued after being stranded in the Mill Creek.   Twenty-nine homes were destroyed, 80 other were damaged or uninhabitable and 304 others were damaged but still inhabitable.  Thirty-two businesses were damaged or destroyed, twelve public buildings or pieces of equipment were destroyed and eighteen public parks were damaged.  Flooding was extensive along the Neshaminy Basin from Warrington Township to Bristol Township.  In Middletown Township homes along Bridle Drive and Periwinkle Avenue were severely flooded.  One house was swept 10 feet off its foundation.  Several underground heating oil tanks erupted.  In Northampton Township, every bridge over the Neshaminy Creek was closed.  Many cars became stranded after driving around barricades.  Persons were rescued from car tops.  The Langhorne Players Building was destroyed. In Warrington Township five homes along the Little Neshaminy Creek were deemed uninhabitable. The second hard hit area was in townships along the Delaware River as the evening high tide slowed the discharge of streams into the river.  Evacuations occurred along the Delaware River in Yardley and Lower Makefield Township, two people were rescued from 10 feet of water.  Elsewhere in the county, flooding along the East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek forced the evacuation of downtown Sellersville.  In Upper Southampton Township, two homes collapsed because of the heavy rain.   Nearly every creek and even some lakes (Silver Lake in Bristol Borough) overflowed. High winds also took their toll.  A Perkasie woman was injured trying to remove a downed tree.  A fallen tree severely damaged a house in Falls Township.  The SEPTA Regional rail service to trenton was stopped because of downed trees on the tracks. Seventy roads were closed and included long stretches of Pennsylvania State Route 611. Seven roads were too damaged to be reopened in Buckingham, Lower Makefield and Upper Makefield Townships.  They were still closed on the 25th.  Pennsylvania State Route 32 in Solebury Township was expected to be closed indefinitely.  Bridges were damaged or washed out in Buckingham, Durham, Solebury, Upper Makefield and Wrightstown Townships. Three bridges were destroyed and were not expected to be reopened until 2001.  They are River Road (Pennsylvania State Route 32) over the Jericho Creek in Upper Makefield Township, New Hope Road over the Mill Creek in Buckingham Townships and Swamp Road over the Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township.  Delaware County was the second hardest hit county in the state, but no location was hit harder than Darby Borough as flooding along the Darby and Cobb Creeks cut off and decimated the borough.  Seven hundred people were evacuated, one hundred were rescued by boat, 11 were plucked from flood waters. The creek devoured residents and businesses along Mill and Walnut Streets. Twenty-five businesses were in ruin; a bank and liquor store disappeared under eight feet of flood water. A delivery van floated into six 2,000 gallon tanks containing toxic solvents, four were recovered.  An ice machine was recovered half a mile downstream.  The Colwyn section of Lansdowne Borough was also hard hit  by the Darby Creek flooding.  During the evening of the 16th about 1,000 persons were evacuated in the Crum Creek Valley in Marple, Media, Nether Providence, Ridley, Swarthmore, and Upper Providence Townships.  Officials feared the record rainfall would damage the Springton Reservoir Dam's spillway.  Other evacuations occurred along the Chester Creek in Aston, Brookhaven, Chester City and Upland Borough.  The Chester Creek in Chester had its second highest crest on record since 1971. Tidal flooding also forced the evacuation of about 500 people along the Delaware River in Marcus Hook.  Flooding forced evacuations along the Marcus Hook in Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough. Intense flooding along Pennsylvania State Route 291 forced the evacuation of 200 people in Tinicum Township. Numerous roads were closed and several were damaged.  Two were still closed on the 21st. Numerous water rescues occurred. A Lansdowne firefighter was injured while trying to rescue several children stuck in a tree. A 58-year-old woman was injured when she inadvertently lit an M80 instead of a candle. Mud reached three to four feet high in the business district of Aston Township.  The high winds downed numerous trees across the county.  One tree damaged a home in Media Borough.   Delaware and Chester Counties bore the brunt of the power outages in PECO Energy's service area.   In Montgomery County, about 1,500 persons were evacuated.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas of Abington, Collegeville, Conshohocken, Lower Moreland, Upper Dublin, Upper Moreland and West Norriton Townships.   In Upper Dublin Township, 100 residents and 65 children were evacuated after water overflowed the top of the Loch Alsh Reservoir. Numerous water rescues occurred, some from car tops. In Conshohocken, a regional rail car became surrounded by 6 feet of flood waters from the Plymouth Creek quickly. Ten people were trapped.  A rescue boat sent capsized and several passengers clung to a tree for a couple of hours before finally being rescued.  About 75 persons were rescued from flood waters in Upper Dublin and Springfield Townships, many in the Fort Washington Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In Upper Milford Township, a man was rescued after being sucked into an over flow pipe.  In Lower Providence Township, a 13-year-old girl was rescued after falling into Mine Run Creek.   Ninety-two homes were deemed uninhabitable and 538 others were damaged, but uninhabitable.  Ninety-one businesses and 461 apartments were damaged.  Hardest hit in the county was Lower Moreland Township.  About 100 apartment units in the Huntingdon Valley Condominiums were flooded and contaminated by raw sewage, heating oil and gasoline.  All first floor units lost their possessions.  The second hardest hit area was along the Schuylkill River from Upper Providence Township south to Conshohocken.  In Upper Providence Township, flooding reached the first floor in Port Providence. Numerous trees were knocked down throughout the county and damaged several vehicles. In Chester County, severe and record breaking flooding was reported along the branches and main stem of the Brandywine Creek.  In Modena along the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, twenty households were evacuated, the first evacuations 31 years.  Along the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek, a small residential community was leveled in East Bradford Township with losses reaching 90 percent.  The flood stage was about 1 foot higher than occurred with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Gibson's Covered Bridge was severely damaged as trees smashed into hits roof.  Farther upstream in Downingtown, twenty homes were severely damaged as fuel oil leaked from their tanks in flooded basements.  Fifty other homes were severely damaged and hundreds others had minimal damage.  In Phoenixville, thirty people were rescued or evacuated near the Schuylkill River.  Severe flooding closed sections of Pennsylvania State Route 100 and United States Routes 1 and 30, especially near the Valley and Brandywine Creeks.  Chester County was hit the hardest in the Philadelphia area with respect to wind damage.  Houses were damaged by fallen trees in Kenneth Square, Oxford and West Bradford Townships.  A PECO linesman was injured after a tree fell on his ladder.  Both the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek at Downingtown and the main stem Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford (Delaware/Chester county line) had record crests, the previous record occurred during Hurricane Agnes in June of 1972.  Chester and Delaware Counties bore the brunt of the 412,000 outages in PECO Energy's service area.    In Philadelphia, the worst flooding occurred along Cobbs Creek along the Philadelphia/Delaware County border.  About 1,000 people were evacuated and 3,500 homes were flooded.  Jet skis were used to rescue people.  In Manayunk, flooding along the Schuylkill River covered Main Street.  Many basements were flooded and one worker was rescued from a flooded basement.  Four hundred people were stranded at the Radisson Hotel near the Philadelphia International Airport. Some foundations were undermined in the city's Roxborough section.

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around six inches in the Poconos and Berks County,  eight inches in the Lehigh Valley and from eight to twelve inches in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.  Six people died directly from the hurricane - four drownings and two persons were hit by trees.  The hurricane also indirectly contributed to the death of about seven other persons.  About 40 persons were seriously injured. There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About  7,000 persons were evacuated, more than half were from Delaware and Bucks Counties, the two hardest hit counties in the state.  The Preliminary damage estimate was 60 million dollars. Damage to infrastructure was around 20 million dollars and hundreds of roads and dozens of bridges were damaged or closed.  A couple of bridges in Bucks County are not expected to be reopened until 2001. About 200 houses were seriously damaged or destroyed, another 1,000 were damaged but still inhabitable.  Over 10,000 homes were flooded.  Over 500 apartments were also damaged as were over 100 businesses. The flooding affected fourteen key regional rail service lines around Philadelphia, many were closed and/or damaged. About 501,000 homes and businesses lost power - 412,000 in the PECO Service area in Southeast Pennsylvania, the second worst outage in the company's history.   School children were dismissed early. Sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers. The first directly related hurricane death occurred in East Nottingham Township in Chester County.  A 53-year-old woman was crushed when a tree fell through her house.  In Montgomery County three persons drowned in their vehicles when they attempted to drive across flooded roadways.  One drove around barricades.  A 49-year-old male was found inside his vehicle in the Perkiomen Creek in Perkiomen Valley Park.  His disabled vehicle apparently was swept into the creek.  A 73-year-old woman was found inside her vehicle in the Wissahickon Creek in Whitemarsh Township.  Her vehicle was swept off the road and became pinned against a tree along the banks of the creek.  A 47-year-old man in West Conshohocken drowned after he drove around barricades and became stuck in flood waters.  His father who was a passenger in the car escaped.  In Delaware County, a 67-year-old man drowned in Darby Borough while delivering pizzas.  His van was caught in the swirling waters of the Darby Creek.  In Philadelphia, a 48-year-old man was crushed by a fallen tree as he was waiting for a green light in Fairmount Park.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd contributed to the death of a family (3 persons) on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Chester County and a 44 year-old man in Upper Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County.  Two other men in Montgomery County (a 61-year-old and a 51-year-old) suffered heart attacks and died while trying to remove water from his basement and while being evacuated.  A third (67-year-old) man died of a heart attack in Chester County (West Whiteland Township) while trying to push his vehicle from flood waters on Pennsylvania State Route 100.   The highest verifiable storm total was 12.13 inches in Marcus Hook (Delaware County).  Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest precipitation coincided near the ""fall line"" in Southeast Pennsylvania.  The fall line is the boundary between the coastal plain and the Piedmont and represents the first significant rise of the land from near sea level.  The onshore flow being lifted over this geographic feature dumped the heaviest rain around this area and fell across northern Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and Lower Montgomery and Bucks Counties.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in locations in and around the ""fall line"" and several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crests on record.  The combination of winds funneling up Delaware Bay and the river and the record runoff from inland waterways produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Delaware, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties.   Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees. Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Berks County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved westward, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category (Major) IV Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was also a very large in size hurricane that would prolong the extent of both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward along the fall line and dropped the heaviest rain near this geographic feature.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 5 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into the Poconos by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain crossed the Mason/Dixon Line. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state.   But the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Floyd hit Bucks County the hardest, especially in the Neshaminy Creek Basin.  The Neshaminy Creek had its second highest crest on record only surpassed by Hurricanes Connie and Diane in 1955.  About 2,000 people were evacuated and numerous rescues occurred.  In Buckingham Township, 11 school children and the bus driver were rescued after being stranded in the Mill Creek.   Twenty-nine homes were destroyed, 80 other were damaged or uninhabitable and 304 others were damaged but still inhabitable.  Thirty-two businesses were damaged or destroyed, twelve public buildings or pieces of equipment were destroyed and eighteen public parks were damaged.  Flooding was extensive along the Neshaminy Basin from Warrington Township to Bristol Township.  In Middletown Township homes along Bridle Drive and Periwinkle Avenue were severely flooded.  One house was swept 10 feet off its foundation.  Several underground heating oil tanks erupted.  In Northampton Township, every bridge over the Neshaminy Creek was closed.  Many cars became stranded after driving around barricades.  Persons were rescued from car tops.  The Langhorne Players Building was destroyed. In Warrington Township five homes along the Little Neshaminy Creek were deemed uninhabitable. The second hard hit area was in townships along the Delaware River as the evening high tide slowed the discharge of streams into the river.  Evacuations occurred along the Delaware River in Yardley and Lower Makefield Township, two people were rescued from 10 feet of water.  Elsewhere in the county, flooding along the East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek forced the evacuation of downtown Sellersville.  In Upper Southampton Township, two homes collapsed because of the heavy rain.   Nearly every creek and even some lakes (Silver Lake in Bristol Borough) overflowed. High winds also took their toll.  A Perkasie woman was injured trying to remove a downed tree.  A fallen tree severely damaged a house in Falls Township.  The SEPTA Regional rail service to trenton was stopped because of downed trees on the tracks. Seventy roads were closed and included long stretches of Pennsylvania State Route 611. Seven roads were too damaged to be reopened in Buckingham, Lower Makefield and Upper Makefield Townships.  They were still closed on the 25th.  Pennsylvania State Route 32 in Solebury Township was expected to be closed indefinitely.  Bridges were damaged or washed out in Buckingham, Durham, Solebury, Upper Makefield and Wrightstown Townships. Three bridges were destroyed and were not expected to be reopened until 2001.  They are River Road (Pennsylvania State Route 32) over the Jericho Creek in Upper Makefield Township, New Hope Road over the Mill Creek in Buckingham Townships and Swamp Road over the Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township.  Delaware County was the second hardest hit county in the state, but no location was hit harder than Darby Borough as flooding along the Darby and Cobb Creeks cut off and decimated the borough.  Seven hundred people were evacuated, one hundred were rescued by boat, 11 were plucked from flood waters. The creek devoured residents and businesses along Mill and Walnut Streets. Twenty-five businesses were in ruin; a bank and liquor store disappeared under eight feet of flood water. A delivery van floated into six 2,000 gallon tanks containing toxic solvents, four were recovered.  An ice machine was recovered half a mile downstream.  The Colwyn section of Lansdowne Borough was also hard hit  by the Darby Creek flooding.  During the evening of the 16th about 1,000 persons were evacuated in the Crum Creek Valley in Marple, Media, Nether Providence, Ridley, Swarthmore, and Upper Providence Townships.  Officials feared the record rainfall would damage the Springton Reservoir Dam's spillway.  Other evacuations occurred along the Chester Creek in Aston, Brookhaven, Chester City and Upland Borough.  The Chester Creek in Chester had its second highest crest on record since 1971. Tidal flooding also forced the evacuation of about 500 people along the Delaware River in Marcus Hook.  Flooding forced evacuations along the Marcus Hook in Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough. Intense flooding along Pennsylvania State Route 291 forced the evacuation of 200 people in Tinicum Township. Numerous roads were closed and several were damaged.  Two were still closed on the 21st. Numerous water rescues occurred. A Lansdowne firefighter was injured while trying to rescue several children stuck in a tree. A 58-year-old woman was injured when she inadvertently lit an M80 instead of a candle. Mud reached three to four feet high in the business district of Aston Township.  The high winds downed numerous trees across the county.  One tree damaged a home in Media Borough.   Delaware and Chester Counties bore the brunt of the power outages in PECO Energy's service area.   In Montgomery County, about 1,500 persons were evacuated.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas of Abington, Collegeville, Conshohocken, Lower Moreland, Upper Dublin, Upper Moreland and West Norriton Townships.   In Upper Dublin Township, 100 residents and 65 children were evacuated after water overflowed the top of the Loch Alsh Reservoir. Numerous water rescues occurred, some from car tops. In Conshohocken, a regional rail car became surrounded by 6 feet of flood waters from the Plymouth Creek quickly. Ten people were trapped.  A rescue boat sent capsized and several passengers clung to a tree for a couple of hours before finally being rescued.  About 75 persons were rescued from flood waters in Upper Dublin and Springfield Townships, many in the Fort Washington Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In Upper Milford Township, a man was rescued after being sucked into an over flow pipe.  In Lower Providence Township, a 13-year-old girl was rescued after falling into Mine Run Creek.   Ninety-two homes were deemed uninhabitable and 538 others were damaged, but uninhabitable.  Ninety-one businesses and 461 apartments were damaged.  Hardest hit in the county was Lower Moreland Township.  About 100 apartment units in the Huntingdon Valley Condominiums were flooded and contaminated by raw sewage, heating oil and gasoline.  All first floor units lost their possessions.  The second hardest hit area was along the Schuylkill River from Upper Providence Township south to Conshohocken.  In Upper Providence Township, flooding reached the first floor in Port Providence. Numerous trees were knocked down throughout the county and damaged several vehicles. In Chester County, severe and record breaking flooding was reported along the branches and main stem of the Brandywine Creek.  In Modena along the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, twenty households were evacuated, the first evacuations 31 years.  Along the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek, a small residential community was leveled in East Bradford Township with losses reaching 90 percent.  The flood stage was about 1 foot higher than occurred with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Gibson's Covered Bridge was severely damaged as trees smashed into hits roof.  Farther upstream in Downingtown, twenty homes were severely damaged as fuel oil leaked from their tanks in flooded basements.  Fifty other homes were severely damaged and hundreds others had minimal damage.  In Phoenixville, thirty people were rescued or evacuated near the Schuylkill River.  Severe flooding closed sections of Pennsylvania State Route 100 and United States Routes 1 and 30, especially near the Valley and Brandywine Creeks.  Chester County was hit the hardest in the Philadelphia area with respect to wind damage.  Houses were damaged by fallen trees in Kenneth Square, Oxford and West Bradford Townships.  A PECO linesman was injured after a tree fell on his ladder.  Both the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek at Downingtown and the main stem Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford (Delaware/Chester county line) had record crests, the previous record occurred during Hurricane Agnes in June of 1972.  Chester and Delaware Counties bore the brunt of the 412,000 outages in PECO Energy's service area.    In Philadelphia, the worst flooding occurred along Cobbs Creek along the Philadelphia/Delaware County border.  About 1,000 people were evacuated and 3,500 homes were flooded.  Jet skis were used to rescue people.  In Manayunk, flooding along the Schuylkill River covered Main Street.  Many basements were flooded and one worker was rescued from a flooded basement.  Four hundred people were stranded at the Radisson Hotel near the Philadelphia International Airport. Some foundations were undermined in the city's Roxborough section.  Numerous trees were knocked down, several damaged vehicles around the University of Pennsylvania.  Tidal flooding along the Delaware River also caused some moderate flooding in low lying areas on the river around 7 p.m. EDT.In Berks County, the effects of Floyd relatively speaking diminished.  Nevertheless, numerous creeks and the Schuylkill River flooded. Many basements were flooded and numerous roads were closed into the morning of the 17th due to either standing water and/or debris.  About 15 people were evacuated along the Allegheny (Robeson Township) and Sacony (Kutztown Borough) Creeks.  Flooding along the Stony Creek forced the evacuation of a high school at 11 a.m. EDT.  Flooding was also reported along the Hay and Monocacy Creeks.  Water rescues were performed in Exeter and Longswamp Townships. About 31,500 homes and businesses lost power in the county due to downed trees and wires.  Power was totally restored on the 20th.  In the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos the winds of Floyd were as much of a problem as were the heavy rains.  Numerous trees were knocked down.  In Northampton County, there were over 100 calls for removal of downed trees.  Downed trees closed U.S. Route 209 in Carbon County.  GPU Energy reported 16,325 homes and businesses lost power in the Lehigh Valley and all power was restored on the 17th. PPL reported 41,000 homes and businesses lost power in their Eastern Pennsylvania service area.  The heavy rain pushed numerous streams over bankfull.  The Bushkill (Northampton County), Cedar (Lehigh County), Jordan (Lehigh County), Little Lehigh (Lehigh County), Monocacy (Lehigh County), Saucon (Lehigh County) and Trout (Monroe and Lehigh County) Creeks all flooded.  Flooding and road closures were reported along U.S Route 22 and Pennsylvania State Routes 309,313,512 and 611. Numerous basements were flooded and several smaller roads were washed out.  A mudslide closed Pennsylvania State Route 611 in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area. The city of Allentown stopped drawing water from the Little Lehigh Creek because it was becoming contaminated with dirt and other substances.

Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Berks County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved westward, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category (Major) IV Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was also a very large in size hurricane that would prolong the extent of both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward along the fall line and dropped the heaviest rain near this geographic feature.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 5 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into the Poconos by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain crossed the Mason/Dixon Line. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state.   But the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Floyd hit Bucks County the hardest, especially in the Neshaminy Creek Basin.  The Neshaminy Creek had its second highest crest on record only surpassed by Hurricanes Connie and Diane in 1955.  About 2,000 people were evacuated and numerous rescues occurred.  In Buckingham Township, 11 school children and the bus driver were rescued after being stranded in the Mill Creek.   Twenty-nine homes were destroyed, 80 other were damaged or uninhabitable and 304 others were damaged but still inhabitable.  Thirty-two businesses were damaged or destroyed, twelve public buildings or pieces of equipment were destroyed and eighteen public parks were damaged.  Flooding was extensive along the Neshaminy Basin from Warrington Township to Bristol Township.  In Middletown Township homes along Bridle Drive and Periwinkle Avenue were severely flooded.  One house was swept 10 feet off its foundation.  Several underground heating oil tanks erupted.  In Northampton Township, every bridge over the Neshaminy Creek was closed.  Many cars became stranded after driving around barricades.  Persons were rescued from car tops.  The Langhorne Players Building was destroyed. In Warrington Township five homes along the Little Neshaminy Creek were deemed uninhabitable. The second hard hit area was in townships along the Delaware River as the evening high tide slowed the discharge of streams into the river.  Evacuations occurred along the Delaware River in Yardley and Lower Makefield Township, two people were rescued from 10 feet of water.  Elsewhere in the county, flooding along the East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek forced the evacuation of downtown Sellersville.  In Upper Southampton Township, two homes collapsed because of the heavy rain.   Nearly every creek and even some lakes (Silver Lake in Bristol Borough) overflowed. High winds also took their toll.  A Perkasie woman was injured trying to remove a downed tree.  A fallen tree severely damaged a house in Falls Township.  The SEPTA Regional rail service to trenton was stopped because of downed trees on the tracks. Seventy roads were closed and included long stretches of Pennsylvania State Route 611. Seven roads were too damaged to be reopened in Buckingham, Lower Makefield and Upper Makefield Townships.  They were still closed on the 25th.  Pennsylvania State Route 32 in Solebury Township was expected to be closed indefinitely.  Bridges were damaged or washed out in Buckingham, Durham, Solebury, Upper Makefield and Wrightstown Townships. Three bridges were destroyed and were not expected to be reopened until 2001.  They are River Road (Pennsylvania State Route 32) over the Jericho Creek in Upper Makefield Township, New Hope Road over the Mill Creek in Buckingham Townships and Swamp Road over the Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township.  Delaware County was the second hardest hit county in the state, but no location was hit harder than Darby Borough as flooding along the Darby and Cobb Creeks cut off and decimated the borough.  Seven hundred people were evacuated, one hundred were rescued by boat, 11 were plucked from flood waters. The creek devoured residents and businesses along Mill and Walnut Streets. Twenty-five businesses were in ruin; a bank and liquor store disappeared under eight feet of flood water. A delivery van floated into six 2,000 gallon tanks containing toxic solvents, four were recovered.  An ice machine was recovered half a mile downstream.  The Colwyn section of Lansdowne Borough was also hard hit  by the Darby Creek flooding.  During the evening of the 16th about 1,000 persons were evacuated in the Crum Creek Valley in Marple, Media, Nether Providence, Ridley, Swarthmore, and Upper Providence Townships.  Officials feared the record rainfall would damage the Springton Reservoir Dam's spillway.  Other evacuations occurred along the Chester Creek in Aston, Brookhaven, Chester City and Upland Borough.  The Chester Creek in Chester had its second highest crest on record since 1971. Tidal flooding also forced the evacuation of about 500 people along the Delaware River in Marcus Hook.  Flooding forced evacuations along the Marcus Hook in Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough. Intense flooding along Pennsylvania State Route 291 forced the evacuation of 200 people in Tinicum Township. Numerous roads were closed and several were damaged.  Two were still closed on the 21st. Numerous water rescues occurred. A Lansdowne firefighter was injured while trying to rescue several children stuck in a tree. A 58-year-old woman was injured when she inadvertently lit an M80 instead of a candle. Mud reached three to four feet high in the business district of Aston Township.  The high winds downed numerous trees across the county.  One tree damaged a home in Media Borough.   Delaware and Chester Counties bore the brunt of the power outages in PECO Energy's service area.   In Montgomery County, about 1,500 persons were evacuated.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas of Abington, Collegeville, Conshohocken, Lower Moreland, Upper Dublin, Upper Moreland and West Norriton Townships.   In Upper Dublin Township, 100 residents and 65 children were evacuated after water overflowed the top of the Loch Alsh Reservoir. Numerous water rescues occurred, some from car tops. In Conshohocken, a regional rail car became surrounded by 6 feet of flood waters from the Plymouth Creek quickly. Ten people were trapped.  A rescue boat sent capsized and several passengers clung to a tree for a couple of hours before finally being rescued.  About 75 persons were rescued from flood waters in Upper Dublin and Springfield Townships, many in the Fort Washington Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In Upper Milford Township, a man was rescued after being sucked into an over flow pipe.  In Lower Providence Township, a 13-year-old girl was rescued after falling into Mine Run Creek.   Ninety-two homes were deemed uninhabitable and 538 others were damaged, but uninhabitable.  Ninety-one businesses and 461 apartments were damaged.  Hardest hit in the county was Lower Moreland Township.  About 100 apartment units in the Huntingdon Valley Condominiums were flooded and contaminated by raw sewage, heating oil and gasoline.  All first floor units lost their possessions.  The second hardest hit area was along the Schuylkill River from Upper Providence Township south to Conshohocken.  In Upper Providence Township, flooding reached the first floor in Port Providence. Numerous trees were knocked down throughout the county and damaged several vehicles. In Chester County, severe and record breaking flooding was reported along the branches and main stem of the Brandywine Creek.  In Modena along the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, twenty households were evacuated, the first evacuations 31 years.  Along the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek, a small residential community was leveled in East Bradford Township with losses reaching 90 percent.  The flood stage was about 1 foot higher than occurred with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Gibson's Covered Bridge was severely damaged as trees smashed into hits roof.  Farther upstream in Downingtown, twenty homes were severely damaged as fuel oil leaked from their tanks in flooded basements.  Fifty other homes were severely damaged and hundreds others had minimal damage.  In Phoenixville, thirty people were rescued or evacuated near the Schuylkill River.  Severe flooding closed sections of Pennsylvania State Route 100 and United States Routes 1 and 30, especially near the Valley and Brandywine Creeks.  Chester County was hit the hardest in the Philadelphia area with respect to wind damage.  Houses were damaged by fallen trees in Kenneth Square, Oxford and West Bradford Townships.  A PECO linesman was injured after a tree fell on his ladder.  Both the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek at Downingtown and the main stem Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford (Delaware/Chester county line) had record crests, the previous record occurred during Hurricane Agnes in June of 1972.  Chester and Delaware Counties bore the brunt of the 412,000 outages in PECO Energy's service area.    In Philadelphia, the worst flooding occurred along Cobbs Creek along the Philadelphia/Delaware County border.  About 1,000 people were evacuated and 3,500 homes were flooded.  Jet skis were used to rescue people.  In Manayunk, flooding along the Schuylkill River covered Main Street.  Many basements were flooded and one worker was rescued from a flooded basement.  Four hundred people were stranded at the Radisson Hotel near the Philadelphia International Airport. Some foundations were undermined in the city's Roxborough section.  Numerous trees were knocked down, several damaged vehicles around the University of Pennsylvania.  Tidal flooding along the Delaware River also caused some moderate flooding in low lying areas on the river around 7 p.m. EDT.In Berks County, the effects of Floyd relatively speaking diminished.  Nevertheless, numerous creeks and the Schuylkill River flooded. Many basements were flooded and numerous roads were closed into the morning of the 17th due to either standing water and/or debris.  About 15 people were evacuated along the Allegheny (Robeson Township) and Sacony (Kutztown Borough) Creeks.  Flooding along the Stony Creek forced the evacuation of a high school at 11 a.m. EDT.  Flooding was also reported along the Hay and Monocacy Creeks.  Water rescues were performed in Exeter and Longswamp Townships. About 31,500 homes and businesses lost power in the county due to downed trees and wires.  Power was totally restored on the 20th.  In the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos the winds of Floyd were as much of a problem as were the heavy rains.  Numerous trees were knocked down.  In Northampton County, there were over 100 calls for removal of downed trees.  Downed trees closed U.S. Route 209 in Carbon County.  GPU Energy reported 16,325 homes and businesses lost power in the Lehigh Valley and all power was restored on the 17th. PPL reported 41,000 homes and businesses lost power in their Eastern Pennsylvania service area.  The heavy rain pushed numerous streams over bankfull.  The Bushkill (Northampton County), Cedar (Lehigh County), Jordan (Lehigh County), Little Lehigh (Lehigh County), Monocacy (Lehigh County), Saucon (Lehigh County) and Trout (Monroe and Lehigh County) Creeks all flooded.  Flooding and road closures were reported along U.S Route 22 and Pennsylvania State Routes 309,313,512 and 611. Numerous basements were flooded and several smaller roads were washed out.  A mudslide closed Pennsylvania State Route 611 in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area. The city of Allentown stopped drawing water from the Little Lehigh Creek because it was becoming contaminated with dirt and other substances.  People were rescued from trapped cars in both Lower Macungie (Lehigh County) and Lower Saucon (Northampton County) Townships.

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around six inches in the Poconos and Berks County,  eight inches in the Lehigh Valley and from eight to twelve inches in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.  Six people died directly from the hurricane - four drownings and two persons were hit by trees.  The hurricane also indirectly contributed to the death of about seven other persons.  About 40 persons were seriously injured. There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About  7,000 persons were evacuated, more than half were from Delaware and Bucks Counties, the two hardest hit counties in the state.  The Preliminary damage estimate was 60 million dollars. Damage to infrastructure was around 20 million dollars and hundreds of roads and dozens of bridges were damaged or closed.  A couple of bridges in Bucks County are not expected to be reopened until 2001. About 200 houses were seriously damaged or destroyed, another 1,000 were damaged but still inhabitable.  Over 10,000 homes were flooded.  Over 500 apartments were also damaged as were over 100 businesses. The flooding affected fourteen key regional rail service lines around Philadelphia, many were closed and/or damaged. About 501,000 homes and businesses lost power - 412,000 in the PECO Service area in Southeast Pennsylvania, the second worst outage in the company's history.   School children were dismissed early. Sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers. The first directly related hurricane death occurred in East Nottingham Township in Chester County.  A 53-year-old woman was crushed when a tree fell through her house.  In Montgomery County three persons drowned in their vehicles when they attempted to drive across flooded roadways.  One drove around barricades.  A 49-year-old male was found inside his vehicle in the Perkiomen Creek in Perkiomen Valley Park.  His disabled vehicle apparently was swept into the creek.  A 73-year-old woman was found inside her vehicle in the Wissahickon Creek in Whitemarsh Township.  Her vehicle was swept off the road and became pinned against a tree along the banks of the creek.  A 47-year-old man in West Conshohocken drowned after he drove around barricades and became stuck in flood waters.  His father who was a passenger in the car escaped.  In Delaware County, a 67-year-old man drowned in Darby Borough while delivering pizzas.  His van was caught in the swirling waters of the Darby Creek.  In Philadelphia, a 48-year-old man was crushed by a fallen tree as he was waiting for a green light in Fairmount Park.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd contributed to the death of a family (3 persons) on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Chester County and a 44 year-old man in Upper Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County.  Two other men in Montgomery County (a 61-year-old and a 51-year-old) suffered heart attacks and died while trying to remove water from his basement and while being evacuated.  A third (67-year-old) man died of a heart attack in Chester County (West Whiteland Township) while trying to push his vehicle from flood waters on Pennsylvania State Route 100.   The highest verifiable storm total was 12.13 inches in Marcus Hook (Delaware County).  Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest precipitation coincided near the ""fall line"" in Southeast Pennsylvania.  The fall line is the boundary between the coastal plain and the Piedmont and represents the first significant rise of the land from near sea level.  The onshore flow being lifted over this geographic feature dumped the heaviest rain around this area and fell across northern Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and Lower Montgomery and Bucks Counties.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in locations in and around the ""fall line"" and several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crests on record.  The combination of winds funneling up Delaware Bay and the river and the record runoff from inland waterways produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Delaware, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties.   Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees. Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.

Flooding forced evacuations along the Marcus Hook in Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough. Intense flooding along Pennsylvania State Route 291 forced the evacuation of 200 people in Tinicum Township. Numerous roads were closed and several were damaged.  Two were still closed on the 21st. Numerous water rescues occurred. A Lansdowne firefighter was injured while trying to rescue several children stuck in a tree. A 58-year-old woman was injured when she inadvertently lit an M80 instead of a candle. Mud reached three to four feet high in the business district of Aston Township.  The high winds downed numerous trees across the county.  One tree damaged a home in Media Borough.   Delaware and Chester Counties bore the brunt of the power outages in PECO Energy's service area.   In Montgomery County, about 1,500 persons were evacuated.

In Upper Dublin Township, 100 residents and 65 children were evacuated after water overflowed the top of the Loch Alsh Reservoir. Numerous water rescues occurred, some from car tops. In Conshohocken, a regional rail car became surrounded by 6 feet of flood waters from the Plymouth Creek quickly. Ten people were trapped.  A rescue boat sent capsized and several passengers clung to a tree for a couple of hours before finally being rescued.  About 75 persons were rescued from flood waters in Upper Dublin and Springfield Townships, many in the Fort Washington Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In Upper Milford Township, a man was rescued after being sucked into an over flow pipe.  In Lower Providence Township, a 13-year-old girl was rescued after falling into Mine Run Creek.

Hardest hit in the county was Lower Moreland Township.  About 100 apartment units in the Huntingdon Valley Condominiums were flooded and contaminated by raw sewage, heating oil and gasoline.  All first floor units lost their possessions.  The second hardest hit area was along the Schuylkill River from Upper Providence Township south to Conshohocken.  In Upper Providence Township, flooding reached the first floor in Port Providence. Numerous trees were knocked down throughout the county and damaged several vehicles. In Chester County, severe and record breaking flooding was reported along the branches and main stem of the Brandywine Creek.  In Modena along the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, twenty households were evacuated, the first evacuations 31 years.  Along the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek, a small residential community was leveled in East Bradford Township with losses reaching 90 percent.  The flood stage was about 1 foot higher than occurred with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Gibson's Covered Bridge was severely damaged as trees smashed into hits roof.  Farther upstream in Downingtown, twenty homes were severely damaged as fuel oil leaked from their tanks in flooded basements.  Fifty other homes were severely damaged and hundreds others had minimal damage.  In Phoenixville, thirty people were rescued or evacuated near the Schuylkill River.  Severe flooding closed sections of Pennsylvania State Route 100 and United States Routes 1 and 30, especially near the Valley and Brandywine Creeks.  Chester County was hit the hardest in the Philadelphia area with respect to wind damage.  Houses were damaged by fallen trees in Kenneth Square, Oxford and West Bradford Townships.  A PECO linesman was injured after a tree fell on his ladder.  Both the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek at Downingtown and the main stem Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford (Delaware/Chester county line) had record crests, the previous record occurred during Hurricane Agnes in June of 1972.  Chester and Delaware Counties bore the brunt of the 412,000 outages in PECO Energy's service area.    In Philadelphia, the worst flooding occurred along Cobbs Creek along the Philadelphia/Delaware County border.  About 1,000 people were evacuated and 3,500 homes were flooded.  Jet skis were used to rescue people.  In Manayunk, flooding along the Schuylkill River covered Main Street.  Many basements were flooded and one worker was rescued from a flooded basement.  Four hundred people were stranded at the Radisson Hotel near the Philadelphia International Airport. Some foundations were undermined in the city's Roxborough section.  Numerous trees were knocked down, several damaged vehicles around the University of Pennsylvania.  Tidal flooding along the Delaware River also caused some moderate flooding in low lying areas on the river around 7 p.m. EDT.In Berks County, the effects of Floyd relatively speaking diminished.  Nevertheless, numerous creeks and the Schuylkill River flooded. Many basements were flooded and numerous roads were closed into the morning of the 17th due to either standing water and/or debris.  About 15 people were evacuated along the Allegheny (Robeson Township) and Sacony (Kutztown Borough) Creeks.  Flooding along the Stony Creek forced the evacuation of a high school at 11 a.m. EDT.  Flooding was also reported along the Hay and Monocacy Creeks.  Water rescues were performed in Exeter and Longswamp Townships. About 31,500 homes and businesses lost power in the county due to downed trees and wires.  Power was totally restored on the 20th.  In the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos the winds of Floyd were as much of a problem as were the heavy rains.  Numerous trees were knocked down.  In Northampton County, there were over 100 calls for removal of downed trees.  Downed trees closed U.S. Route 209 in Carbon County.  GPU Energy reported 16,325 homes and businesses lost power in the Lehigh Valley and all power was restored on the 17th. PPL reported 41,000 homes and businesses lost power in their Eastern Pennsylvania service area.  The heavy rain pushed numerous streams over bankfull.  The Bushkill (Northampton County), Cedar (Lehigh County), Jordan (Lehigh County), Little Lehigh (Lehigh County), Monocacy (Lehigh County), Saucon (Lehigh County) and Trout (Monroe and Lehigh County) Creeks all flooded.  Flooding and road closures were reported along U.S Route 22 and Pennsylvania State Routes 309,313,512 and 611. Numerous basements were flooded and several smaller roads were washed out.  A mudslide closed Pennsylvania State Route 611 in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area. The city of Allentown stopped drawing water from the Little Lehigh Creek because it was becoming contaminated with dirt and other substances.  People were rescued from trapped cars in both Lower Macungie (Lehigh County) and Lower Saucon (Northampton County) Townships.

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around six inches in the Poconos and Berks County,  eight inches in the Lehigh Valley and from eight to twelve inches in the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area.  Six people died directly from the hurricane - four drownings and two persons were hit by trees.  The hurricane also indirectly contributed to the death of about seven other persons.  About 40 persons were seriously injured. There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About  7,000 persons were evacuated, more than half were from Delaware and Bucks Counties, the two hardest hit counties in the state.  The Preliminary damage estimate was 60 million dollars. Damage to infrastructure was around 20 million dollars and hundreds of roads and dozens of bridges were damaged or closed.  A couple of bridges in Bucks County are not expected to be reopened until 2001. About 200 houses were seriously damaged or destroyed, another 1,000 were damaged but still inhabitable.  Over 10,000 homes were flooded.  Over 500 apartments were also damaged as were over 100 businesses. The flooding affected fourteen key regional rail service lines around Philadelphia, many were closed and/or damaged. About 501,000 homes and businesses lost power - 412,000 in the PECO Service area in Southeast Pennsylvania, the second worst outage in the company's history.   School children were dismissed early. Sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers. The first directly related hurricane death occurred in East Nottingham Township in Chester County.  A 53-year-old woman was crushed when a tree fell through her house.  In Montgomery County three persons drowned in their vehicles when they attempted to drive across flooded roadways.  One drove around barricades.  A 49-year-old male was found inside his vehicle in the Perkiomen Creek in Perkiomen Valley Park.  His disabled vehicle apparently was swept into the creek.  A 73-year-old woman was found inside her vehicle in the Wissahickon Creek in Whitemarsh Township.  Her vehicle was swept off the road and became pinned against a tree along the banks of the creek.  A 47-year-old man in West Conshohocken drowned after he drove around barricades and became stuck in flood waters.  His father who was a passenger in the car escaped.  In Delaware County, a 67-year-old man drowned in Darby Borough while delivering pizzas.  His van was caught in the swirling waters of the Darby Creek.  In Philadelphia, a 48-year-old man was crushed by a fallen tree as he was waiting for a green light in Fairmount Park.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd contributed to the death of a family (3 persons) on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Chester County and a 44 year-old man in Upper Pottsgrove Township in Montgomery County.  Two other men in Montgomery County (a 61-year-old and a 51-year-old) suffered heart attacks and died while trying to remove water from his basement and while being evacuated.  A third (67-year-old) man died of a heart attack in Chester County (West Whiteland Township) while trying to push his vehicle from flood waters on Pennsylvania State Route 100.   The highest verifiable storm total was 12.13 inches in Marcus Hook (Delaware County).  Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest precipitation coincided near the ""fall line"" in Southeast Pennsylvania.  The fall line is the boundary between the coastal plain and the Piedmont and represents the first significant rise of the land from near sea level.  The onshore flow being lifted over this geographic feature dumped the heaviest rain around this area and fell across northern Delaware and Philadelphia Counties and Lower Montgomery and Bucks Counties.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in locations in and around the ""fall line"" and several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crests on record.  The combination of winds funneling up Delaware Bay and the river and the record runoff from inland waterways produced moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Delaware, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties.   Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees. Governor Tom Ridge declared a disaster emergency on the 16th.  President Clinton declared Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Berks County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved westward, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category (Major) IV Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was also a very large in size hurricane that would prolong the extent of both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward along the fall line and dropped the heaviest rain near this geographic feature.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 5 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into the Poconos by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain crossed the Mason/Dixon Line. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state.   But the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Floyd hit Bucks County the hardest, especially in the Neshaminy Creek Basin.  The Neshaminy Creek had its second highest crest on record only surpassed by Hurricanes Connie and Diane in 1955.  About 2,000 people were evacuated and numerous rescues occurred.  In Buckingham Township, 11 school children and the bus driver were rescued after being stranded in the Mill Creek.   Twenty-nine homes were destroyed, 80 other were damaged or uninhabitable and 304 others were damaged but still inhabitable.  Thirty-two businesses were damaged or destroyed, twelve public buildings or pieces of equipment were destroyed and eighteen public parks were damaged.  Flooding was extensive along the Neshaminy Basin from Warrington Township to Bristol Township.  In Middletown Township homes along Bridle Drive and Periwinkle Avenue were severely flooded.  One house was swept 10 feet off its foundation.  Several underground heating oil tanks erupted.  In Northampton Township, every bridge over the Neshaminy Creek was closed.  Many cars became stranded after driving around barricades.  Persons were rescued from car tops.  The Langhorne Players Building was destroyed. In Warrington Township five homes along the Little Neshaminy Creek were deemed uninhabitable. The second hard hit area was in townships along the Delaware River as the evening high tide slowed the discharge of streams into the river.  Evacuations occurred along the Delaware River in Yardley and Lower Makefield Township, two people were rescued from 10 feet of water.  Elsewhere in the county, flooding along the East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek forced the evacuation of downtown Sellersville.  In Upper Southampton Township, two homes collapsed because of the heavy rain.   Nearly every creek and even some lakes (Silver Lake in Bristol Borough) overflowed. High winds also took their toll.  A Perkasie woman was injured trying to remove a downed tree.  A fallen tree severely damaged a house in Falls Township.  The SEPTA Regional rail service to trenton was stopped because of downed trees on the tracks. Seventy roads were closed and included long stretches of Pennsylvania State Route 611. Seven roads were too damaged to be reopened in Buckingham, Lower Makefield and Upper Makefield Townships.  They were still closed on the 25th.  Pennsylvania State Route 32 in Solebury Township was expected to be closed indefinitely.  Bridges were damaged or washed out in Buckingham, Durham, Solebury, Upper Makefield and Wrightstown Townships. Three bridges were destroyed and were not expected to be reopened until 2001.  They are River Road (Pennsylvania State Route 32) over the Jericho Creek in Upper Makefield Township, New Hope Road over the Mill Creek in Buckingham Townships and Swamp Road over the Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township.  Delaware County was the second hardest hit county in the state, but no location was hit harder than Darby Borough as flooding along the Darby and Cobb Creeks cut off and decimated the borough.  Seven hundred people were evacuated, one hundred were rescued by boat, 11 were plucked from flood waters. The creek devoured residents and businesses along Mill and Walnut Streets. Twenty-five businesses were in ruin; a bank and liquor store disappeared under eight feet of flood water. A delivery van floated into six 2,000 gallon tanks containing toxic solvents, four were recovered.  An ice machine was recovered half a mile downstream.  The Colwyn section of Lansdowne Borough was also hard hit  by the Darby Creek flooding.  During the evening of the 16th about 1,000 persons were evacuated in the Crum Creek Valley in Marple, Media, Nether Providence, Ridley, Swarthmore, and Upper Providence Townships.  Officials feared the record rainfall would damage the Springton Reservoir Dam's spillway.  Other evacuations occurred along the Chester Creek in Aston, Brookhaven, Chester City and Upland Borough.  The Chester Creek in Chester had its second highest crest on record since 1971. Tidal flooding also forced the evacuation of about 500 people along the Delaware River in Marcus Hook.  Flooding forced evacuations along the Marcus Hook in Upper Chichester Township and Trainer Borough. Intense flooding along Pennsylvania State Route 291 forced the evacuation of 200 people in Tinicum Township. Numerous roads were closed and several were damaged.  Two were still closed on the 21st. Numerous water rescues occurred. A Lansdowne firefighter was injured while trying to rescue several children stuck in a tree. A 58-year-old woman was injured when she inadvertently lit an M80 instead of a candle. Mud reached three to four feet high in the business district of Aston Township.  The high winds downed numerous trees across the county.  One tree damaged a home in Media Borough.   Delaware and Chester Counties bore the brunt of the power outages in PECO Energy's service area.   In Montgomery County, about 1,500 persons were evacuated.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas of Abington, Collegeville, Conshohocken, Lower Moreland, Upper Dublin, Upper Moreland and West Norriton Townships.   In Upper Dublin Township, 100 residents and 65 children were evacuated after water overflowed the top of the Loch Alsh Reservoir. Numerous water rescues occurred, some from car tops. In Conshohocken, a regional rail car became surrounded by 6 feet of flood waters from the Plymouth Creek quickly. Ten people were trapped.  A rescue boat sent capsized and several passengers clung to a tree for a couple of hours before finally being rescued.  About 75 persons were rescued from flood waters in Upper Dublin and Springfield Townships, many in the Fort Washington Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In Upper Milford Township, a man was rescued after being sucked into an over flow pipe.  In Lower Providence Township, a 13-year-old girl was rescued after falling into Mine Run Creek.   Ninety-two homes were deemed uninhabitable and 538 others were damaged, but uninhabitable.  Ninety-one businesses and 461 apartments were damaged.  Hardest hit in the county was Lower Moreland Township.  About 100 apartment units in the Huntingdon Valley Condominiums were flooded and contaminated by raw sewage, heating oil and gasoline.  All first floor units lost their possessions.  The second hardest hit area was along the Schuylkill River from Upper Providence Township south to Conshohocken.  In Upper Providence Township, flooding reached the first floor in Port Providence. Numerous trees were knocked down throughout the county and damaged several vehicles. In Chester County, severe and record breaking flooding was reported along the branches and main stem of the Brandywine Creek.  In Modena along the West Branch of the Brandywine Creek, twenty households were evacuated, the first evacuations 31 years.  Along the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek, a small residential community was leveled in East Bradford Township with losses reaching 90 percent.  The flood stage was about 1 foot higher than occurred with Hurricane Agnes in 1972.  Gibson's Covered Bridge was severely damaged as trees smashed into hits roof.  Farther upstream in Downingtown, twenty homes were severely damaged as fuel oil leaked from their tanks in flooded basements.

The combination of frequent lightning and flooding from the heavy rain caused about 65,000 PECO Energy customers to lose power during the evening of the 26th in Southeast Pennsylvania.  Hardest hit were Chester and Delaware Counties.  Seven thousand customers were still without power the morning of the 27th.  With respect to the flooding, the hardest hit areas were the southeast half of Chester County, the northeast tip of Delaware County and adjacent sections of Montgomery County.  Storm totals in the hard hit areas averaged between 2.0 and 3.5 inches, most of which fell in two hours between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. EDT.  Heavy rain before dawn on the 26th left the region vulnerable to any additional heavy rain.  In Radnor Township (Delaware County), the storm total was 4.85 inches.  In Lafayette Hills (Montgomery County) 3 inches of rain fell within an hour from 945 p.m. to 1045 p.m. EDT. In Chester County, flooding of underground cables knocked out power to much of Coatesville.  In Montgomery County, flooding of another underground cable forced the closure of the county courthouse on the 27th.  In East Norriton Township, the rain flooded a swimming pool store and caused crystallized chlorine to liquify and leak out.  Police in the area were rescuing persons in trapped vehicles and the build up of chlorine fumes forced them to close nearby roads until the morning of the 27th.  In Delaware County the combination of the torrential rain, small stream flooding and debris clogged storm drains wreaked havoc in Newtown and Radnor Townships.  Many vehicles were floating in flood waters or completely submerged.   Several driveways were washed out and many basements were also flooded.  In Philadelphia, the Frankford Creek at Castor Avenue crested at 9.2 feet before midnight on the 26th.  Flood stage is estimated at 7.0 feet.  No damage though was reported.  Other storm totals included 2.77 inches in King of Prussia (Montgomery County), 2.39 inches in Valley Forge (Chester/Montgomery County border), 1.95 inches in West Chester (Chester County), 1.94 inches in Limerick (Montgomery County), 1.63 inches at the Franklin Institute within Philadelphia and 1.30 inches in Chadds Ford (Delaware County).",NA,PDC

An additional storm developed in northeast Beaver County and merged with the first storm in the northwestern part of the county.

In its wake, heavy rains fell across North Carolina and Virginia into Pennsylvania. Although not nearly as severe as the destruction across areas to the south and east, the middle and lower Susquehanna region of central Pennsylvania endured 24-hour rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches that flooded roads, fields, basements, small streams, and the Conestoga River that flows through the city of Lancaster. President Clinton declared Lancaster and York counties major disaster areas, along with other counties to the east.Hardest hit in the region was Lancaster County. By mid-afternoon Thursday, many roads were closed, school children had been returned home, and water rescues were underway. Most significant flooding began around 2:00 p.m. EDT as rainfall totals in Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Schuylkill, and York counties approached 4 and 5 inches.There were no directly related fatalities in the area, although two people died when their van skidded and struck a tree when the vehicle hydroplaned on the Marietta Pike in Lancaster County. Around 2:00 p.m., a 15-year old boy attempted to bring family pets to safety from the backyard when the waters of Muddy Creek rose rapidly, trapping him. The young man was rescued by boat as he clung to a tree trunk in water up to his chest. A volunteer firefighter was also injured during cleanup when tree branches fell on him and he hit his head on a guardrail. A number of people were stranded in their vehicles when they intentionally drove around road closure signs. Some even moved road barriers so they could proceed.The Conestoga River in the city of Lancaster flooded Thursday evening and crested at 16.39 feet early Friday morning. Major damage occurred on the northeast side of the city, and four neighborhoods were evacuated. The crest was the 4th highest flood of record at the site.Other areas of the lower and middle Susquehanna region endured flooding of a lesser magnitude with flooding of small streams, roads, and basements. A mobile home park in eastern York County was evacuated as waters approached floor levels of the homes.",PDC

An additional storm developed in northeast Beaver County and merged with the first storm in the northwestern part of the county.  Together they combined into an intense thunderstorm complex which produced a swath of wind damage across Western Pennsylvania that punched southeastward through southwest Butler, much of Allegheny, northeast Washington, southwest Westmoreland and northern Fayette counties.  Hundreds of trees and power lines were snapped and toppled.  Approximately 110,000 customers lost power in Allegheny County alone.  This power outage was larger than the one that occurred during the  June 2nd, 1998 tornado which struck the Mt. Washington section of Pittsburgh. Air traffic at the Pittsburgh International Airport was suspended for nearly four hours.  There were also several instances of structural damage to homes and businesses in the form of roof, shingle, and siding damage.  Some small out-building and sheds were also damaged or destroyed.  This rather long-lived macroburst event had an approximate path length of 85 miles and stretched across parts of seven counties.  The width varied from approximately a mile or so to as much as 12 to 14 miles wide, especially across parts of Allegheny County.  Spotters provided several reports of winds reaching 60 to 70 MPH, with some reports as high as 85 MPH.  This macroburst event is comparable in size and strength to the June 30th, 1998 event which roared across Beaver, Allegheny and Westmoreland counties in Western Pennsylvania.  In addition to the damaging winds, the storms produced torrential amounts of rainfall which flooded roadways, under-passes and other low-lying areas, stranding several people in their cars.  Several mud and rock slides were also reported.  There were numerous reports of basement flooding across the region.  The Pittsburgh International Airport reported a record-setting 3.48 inches of rain for the day.",Thunderstorm rains produced minor street flooding and mudslides in the Uniontown area.,PDC

This power outage was larger than the one that occurred during the  June 2nd, 1998 tornado which struck the Mt. Washington section of Pittsburgh. Air traffic at the Pittsburgh International Airport was suspended for nearly four hours.  There were also several instances of structural damage to homes and businesses in the form of roof, shingle, and siding damage.  Some small out-building and sheds were also damaged or destroyed.  This rather long-lived macroburst event had an approximate path length of 85 miles and stretched across parts of seven counties.  The width varied from approximately a mile or so to as much as 12 to 14 miles wide, especially across parts of Allegheny County.  Spotters provided several reports of winds reaching 60 to 70 MPH, with some reports as high as 85 MPH.  This macroburst event is comparable in size and strength to the June 30th, 1998 event which roared across Beaver, Allegheny and Westmoreland counties in Western Pennsylvania.  In addition to the damaging winds, the storms produced torrential amounts of rainfall which flooded roadways, under-passes and other low-lying areas, stranding several people in their cars.  Several mud and rock slides were also reported.  There were numerous reports of basement flooding across the region.  The Pittsburgh International Airport reported a record-setting 3.48 inches of rain for the day.","Thunderstorms passing over the region produced between 3.0 to around 4.5 inches of rain across the county, with the South Hills area of Pittsburgh one of the hardest-hit areas.  Numerous roads across the area were flooded, with five towns (Brentwood, Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, Dormont and West Elizabeth) declaring states of emergency due to flooded roadways.  In Castle Shannon alone, the volunteer fire department estimated damage ""in the hundreds of thousands of dollars"" to their facilities and other businesses in town.  Many other reports of business and residential basement flooding were also received across the area.  Several motorists had to be rescued from their vehicles as they tried to cross flooded roads.  The Port Authority's entire light rail line was disabled due to flooding in the two main power stations that control the signals.",PDC

This rain fell onto ground that was already nearly saturated from heavy rainfall a few days earlier.  These conditions produced moderate flash flooding across the southwest corner of the state starting late on the 18th and continued into the 19th.  However, the heaviest rainfall during this event occurred over the headwaters of the Monongahela River in northern West Virginia, where widespread rainfall exceeding 3.0 inches was recorded.  This produced major river flooding downstream along the Monongahela River towards Pittsburgh.  This rain event also produced minor flooding along the Youghiogheny River. The following are crests/flood stages in feet for several locations along the Monongahela River:  Point Marion  32.3 feet (crest)/26 feet (flood stage); Grays Landing 24.5/22; Maxwell 36.5/32; Charleroi 38.5/28; Elizabeth 27.6/20 and Braddock 24.2/22.  Along the Youghiogheny River, only one forecast point went over flood stage as  Connellsville crested at 12.5 feet, just above the flood stage of 12 feet.  In response to the river flooding, the Governor of Pennsylvania declared a disaster emergency for four counties (Allegheny, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland) in southwest Pennsylvania.  In those four counties, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency estimated just over 600 homes were damaged by the flooding.  However, most of those homes sustained basement damage only.  The hardest-hit county was Washington, where around 400 homes sustained damage.  The city of Monongahela, also in Washington County, appeared to be the hardest-hit community, as 23 homes reported major damage and another 77 received minor damage.  In Allegheny County, the most serious damage appeared to be concentrated in Elizabeth and West Elizabeth where 31 homes had minor damage and one suffered major damage.  In Greene County, although most of the damage was limited to several flooded roads and basements, the Greene Cove Yacht Club reported damage of around $500,000.

This rain fell onto ground that was already nearly saturated from heavy rainfall a few days earlier.  These conditions produced moderate flash flooding across the southwest corner of the state starting late on the 18th and continued into the 19th.  However, the heaviest rainfall during this event occurred over the headwaters of the Monongahela River in northern West Virginia, where widespread rainfall exceeding 3.0 inches was recorded.  This produced major river flooding downstream along the Monongahela River towards Pittsburgh.  This rain event also produced minor flooding along the Youghiogheny River. The following are crests/flood stages in feet for several locations along the Monongahela River:  Point Marion  32.3 feet (crest)/26 feet (flood stage); Grays Landing 24.5/22; Maxwell 36.5/32; Charleroi 38.5/28; Elizabeth 27.6/20 and Braddock 24.2/22.  Along the Youghiogheny River, only one forecast point went over flood stage as  Connellsville crested at 12.5 feet, just above the flood stage of 12 feet.  In response to the river flooding, the Governor of Pennsylvania declared a disaster emergency for four counties (Allegheny, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland) in southwest Pennsylvania.  In those four counties, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency estimated just over 600 homes were damaged by the flooding.  However, most of those homes sustained basement damage only.  The hardest-hit county was Washington, where around 400 homes sustained damage.  The city of Monongahela, also in Washington County, appeared to be the hardest-hit community, as 23 homes reported major damage and another 77 received minor damage.  In Allegheny County, the most serious damage appeared to be concentrated in Elizabeth and West Elizabeth where 31 homes had minor damage and one suffered major damage.  In Greene County, although most of the damage was limited to several flooded roads and basements, the Greene Cove Yacht Club reported damage of around $500,000.

Torrential downpours occurred from early afternoon through the late evening on the 16th. Severe flooding occurred along the Sandy Run, Wissahickon, Pennypack and Neshaminy Basins. The flooding caused and then hampered fire fighters battling an apartment fire in Upper Moreland Township. Six persons perished in the fire. A 63-year-old man died when his 1997 Toyota was swept into the Wissahickon Creek in Whitemarsh Township (Montgomery County). Several bridges were damaged or washed out including a couple on the SEPTA Regional Rail Lines.  About 241 homes were destroyed and 1,386 others were damaged. The torrential rains liquified the ground and caused weak trees to fall over. About 70,000 PECO Energy customers lost power. Both Bucks and Montgomery Counties were declared disaster areas. Preliminary damage estimates were 35 million dollars.  Damage to roads and bridges alone was around 5 million dollars. Montgomery County was hit the hardest with Abington Township, Cheltenham Township, Hatboro Borough, Horsham Township, Lower Moreland Township, Upper Dublin Township and Upper Moreland Township affected the most. In Upper Moreland Township, six people died in an apartment building fire that apparently was triggered by rising flood waters from the nearby Pennypack Creek. Flood waters rose 10 to 20 feet at the Village Green Apartment Complex and inundated the area. Firefighters were rescuing people, some from the second floor, when the complex was struck by a natural gas explosion. The fire apparently started after rising flood waters knocked over hot water heaters in building A of the complex and caused the gas leak. Rising flood waters prevented firefighters from battling the flames. Two buildings in the complex were destroyed by the fire. Two others had smoke and water damage while the remaining 16 buildings were evacuated. About 200 persons were sheltered. Elsewhere in the township, rescuers bcame trapped in the Pennypack Creek trying to save others. Flood damage caused the condemnation of the Bonnet Lane Shopping Center. In Hatboro, four people were trapped by rising flood waters at the Old Mill Inn and about 150 vehicles at a Dodge Dealership were damaged beyond repair. In Whitemarsh Township, a 63 year-old man drowned when his Toyota was found in the Wissahickon Creek. Elsewhere in the township, flooding along the Sandy Run Creek destroyed the SEPTA Fort Washington (R5 Doylestown Line) Bridge. Flood waters also toppled poles that supported the power lines. Repairs were expected to take three weeks. Shuttle buses were used to transport the 12,000 affected commuters. In Abington Township, SEPTA tracks were washed out and cut off the use of the R2 (Warminster) and R3 (Trenton) lines. In Whitpain Township, a storm drain near the swollen Wissahickon Creek was overwhelmed. The flood waters caused the collapse of a warehouse and a 3 to 4 foot surge of water down Maple Street. About 25 families were rescued, some from their second floor or roof. About a dozen homes were damaged by flood waters that reached into the first floor. The Pennsylvania Turnpike was closed between the Willow Grove and Norristown Exits. Except for the Fort Washington Interchange, the turnpike was reopened on the 17th. In Bucks County, Bensalem Township, New Britain Township, Middletown Township, Warminster Township and Warrington Township were hardest hit.  Scores of motorists were trapped in vehicles; house trailers were seen floating. A State of Emergency was declared in Warrington Township as flooding caused a chlorine leak. Elsewhere in the township, people were trapped within a collapsed home. In Philadelphia, flooding along the Wissahickon Creek caused a couple of road closures.  Several roads were also closed in the northern part of the city.In Bucks County, the Neshaminy Creek at Langhorne was above its 9 foot flood stage from 1059 p.m. EDT on the 16th through 421 p.m. EDT on the 17th.

The heavy rainfall caused massive flooding along Bear Creek which impacted numerous roads, homes and bridges in southeastern Luzerne County.  The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was closed northbound between Exits 35 and 38 was closed due to numerous mudslides and flooding.  Water was flowing over many parts of the turnpike where it was closed.  Numerous homes were also flooded as waters rapidly engulfed them in the village of Bear Creek.  Many people were overcome by the floodwaters and had to be rescued from the roofs of their flooded homes by helicopter or boat.  Swift water rescue teams were also deployed and narrowly escaped the flood waters as well.  A hovercraft was rendered useless due to the swift current.  Around 23 patients at a nursing home had to be evacuated due to the flooding and a loss in power.  Bear Creek dam began to spill over which in turn caused Route 115 to flood where it goes over Bear Creek.  School buses also became stranded by the flood waters and were unable to bring at least 25 children home.  The children were forced to spend a night at their school.  12 members of the Pennsylvania National Guard were called out to assist the flood ravaged areas.  A bridge near Bear Creek Village was also in danger of collapsing.  Three roads were closed due to culvert washouts.

Isabel made landfall as a hurricane near Drum Inlet, North Carolina around 100 p.m. EDT on the 18th and weakened as it tracked farther inland. At one time in its life cycle, it was a powerful Category 5 hurricane when it was north of the Leewood Islands. Winds gusted up to 60 mph in Eastern Pennsylvania and downed countless numbers of trees, tree limbs and power lines. It was the worst outage on record for PECO Energy in southeastern Pennsylvania. About 572,425 of its customers lost power. This exceeded the outages that occurred during the ice storm of January 1994. PECO Energy estimated it would cost at least $20 million dollars for it to install about 81 miles of new cable and install about 7,600 new fuses and circuit breakers. The large number of outages was not confined to the southeast part of the state. In Berks County, about 45,000 homes and business lost power. About sixty percent of Metropolitan Edison's 500,000 customers (including Berks County and the Lehigh Valley) lost power from 11,000 separate trouble spots. Pennsylvania Power and Light reported about 500,000 of its customers (including the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos) lost power. This broke their previous record during Tropical Storm Floyd by 150,000. Isabel's track took into western Pennsylvania and was able to funnel water into Delaware River and Bay. Moderate tidal flooding occurred. In Philadelphia, the tide crested at 9.47 feet above mean lower low water. The storm surge was 5.43 feet. The rain was not heavy and the only reported gaged stream flooding was in Chester County.  The heaviest rain with tropical systems often falls west of its storm track, thus the region was spared from the heavier rain.  Peak wind gusts included 60 mph in Forks Township (Northampton County), 49 at the Philadelphia International Airport and the Reading Regional Airport (Berks County), 47 mph at the Lehigh Valley International Airport and 46 mph at the Pocono Mountains Regional Airport (Monroe County). The Valley Creek at Valley Forge (Chester County) was above its 7 foot flood stage from 220 a.m. through 251 a.m. EDT on the 19th and crested at 7.26 feet at 230 a.m. EDT. Storm totals included 1.50 inches in Valley Forge (Chester County), 1.35 inches in Glenmoore (Chester County), 1.16 inches at the Lehigh Valley International Airport, 1.14 inches at the Philadelphia International Airport and 0.81 inches in Mount Pocono (Monroe County).",NA,PDS

The last period of very heavy rain caused many of the creeks in the city to flood. Flooding was reported along the Wissahickon, Frankford, Cobbs and Pennypack Creeks. Flooding also occurred along the Schuylkill River. Storm totals averaged five to six inches. The heavy rain caused widespread urban and poor drainage flooding. Flooding along the Schuylkill River occurred in the city's East Falls section and caused the evacuation of one elderly resident. It also caused the closure of both Kelly Drive and River Road. The Schuylkill River in Philadelphia was above its 11 foot flood stage from 1048 p.m. EDT on the 8th through 1224 p.m. EDT on the 9th. It crested at 12.07 feet at 630 a.m. EDT on the 9th.

The statewide average precipitation total was 6.49 inches, 3.31 inches wetter than normal. Only 1976 (6.59 inches) was wetter. October 2005 was the wettest October on record at the Philadelphia International Airport with a precipitation total of 8.68 inches, 5.93 inches wetter than normal and surpassed the previous record by 2.02 inches.  The cold front moved from near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at 8 p.m. EDT on the 7th, to the Susquehanna Valley in Pennsylvania at 2 a.m. EDT on the 8th, to the Poconos and Berks County in Pennsylvania and just west of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland at 8 a.m. EDT on the 8th. The cold front stalled as waves of low pressure road northeast along it. At 2 p.m. EDT on the 8th, the cold front just edged into northwestern New Jersey and the Philadelphia northwest suburbs and was still west of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. At 8 p.m. EDT that evening the cold front barely moved into the Philadelphia New Jersey suburbs and the Delmarva Peninsula. The cold front and waves of low pressure cleared the Delaware and New Jersey coasts between Midnight EDT and 2 a.m. EDT on the 9th. The slow movement and stalling coupled with an unstable air mass and tropical moisture associated with Tammy helped enhance the torrential downpours. The flooding would have been even worse if not for the unseasonably dry weather that preceded this event from the middle of August.",NA,PDS

Emergency responders told people to not walk into flooded waters because it might contain sewage and other contaminants. Many homes also had oil in their basements from ruptured tanks. There was also concern about persons with individual wells having their drinking water compromised. An explosion of mold and mosquitoes was expected in the wake of the flood. Crops closest to the ground were also impacted by the flood and included cabbage, cucumbers, strawberries, spinach and squash.

Event precipitation totals averaged 4 to 9 inches, except in Berks County where 6 to 12 inches fell.  One drowning occurred in Philadelphia. The heavy rain caused widespread poor drainage flooding as well as moderate flooding along the Delaware and Schuylkill Basins and minor to moderate flooding along the Lehigh River Basin. Crests in the upper Schuylkill, Lehigh and Delaware River Basins were higher than what occurred with Irene the previous month and the highest crests since late June of 2006 in most instances. The crests along the Delaware River were 2 to 4 feet higher than what occurred during Irene. Some of the smaller streams in southeastern Pennsylvania reached major flooding levels, but most of those crests were lower than what occurred with Irene. In addition to the freshwater flooding, moderate tidal flooding occurred along the lower Delaware River and its tributaries. ||In the most recent available flooding assessment for Eastern Pennsylvania, there were 22 homes and businesses that were destroyed, 201 that suffered major damage, 672 that had minor damage and 1217 others that were affected. The preliminary damage estimate for the state of Pennsylvania was five hundred million dollars.  Please look for possible updates in future monthly issues of stormdata.| |The combination of fresh water runoff and a weak southerly flow produced moderate tidal flooding during the evening high tide cycles from the 7th through the 9th and minor tidal flooding with all of the other high tide cycles from the evening of the 6th through overnight on the 11th. The highest tides occurred during the evening high tide cycle on the 8th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties and the evening high tide cycle on the 9th in Bucks County.  The evening high tide on the 8th in Philadelphia reached 9.41 feet above mean lower low water. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. The high tide in Newbold Island (Bucks County) reached 12.11 feet above mean lower low water. There is no current categorical tide gage information for this site.  ||Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana during the morning of the 4th and moved slowly northeast. An approaching cold front from the Mississippi Valley reached Lee by the morning of the 5th and transformed it to an extratropical system on the 5th in Mississippi. The same cold front acted as a conduit for Lee's moisture farther to the northeast. Showers and thunderstorms from that approaching cold front arrived during the evening and overnight on the 5th  and set off the first round of flash flooding rains in Northeast Pennsylvania. The front then stalled just south of Delmarva on the 6th. A relative lull in the rain then occurred during the morning of the 6th. As the front started to back north as a warm front later in the day on the 6th, more bands of heavier rain returned that afternoon and particularly that evening. A blocking weather pattern then moved the frontal boundary little from the morning of the 7th into the morning of the 8th across southeast Pennsylvania. A couple of bands of flash flood producing rains started to form and move east into Eastern Pennsylvania during the late afternoon and evening of the 7th and continued through the night.  The frontal boundary started to drift offshore later in the day on the 8th and most of the precipitation associated with Lee was done.",A second band of showers and thunderstorms with heavy rain caused flash flooding of smaller streams and poor drainage areas in the eastern part of Chester County during the late afternoon and early evening of the 7th.

This caused an all-time record breaking rainfall in Philadelphia as well as flash flooding in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties and also in parts of the Poconos and Lehigh Valley. Doppler Radar storm total estimates and or actual measurements reached around 4 inches in parts of the Lehigh Valley, 6 to 8 inches in parts of the Poconos and around 8 inches in parts of the local Philadelphia area.  The daily rainfall measurement of 8.02 inches at the Philadelphia International Airport was not only the all-time calendar day record but was estimated to be a one in thousand year event. This event also helped establish back-to-back all-time monthly rainfall records in Philadelphia. The July 2013 precipitation total of 13.24 inches was a new monthly record for Philadelphia and came on the heels of a record breaking 10.56 inches falling in June. The current normal meteorological summer seasonal precipitation average for Philadelphia is 11.28 inches.","Thunderstorms with very heavy rain caused urban and poor drainage flash flooding in Philadelphia. Multiple ramps of Interstate 95 around Broad Street were closed. A 21-year-old woman drowned after she accidentally drove into the Schuylkill River near Boathouse Road in Philadelphia.

SEPTA Regional rail lines reported flooding on tracks within Philadelphia. The flooding rains caused portions of Terminal A at Philadelphia International Airport to lose power. Departure and arrival delays reached 90 minutes and seventeen flights were cancelled. Event precipitation totals included 8.26 inches at the Philadelphia International Airport and 1.84 inches in Center City.  The precipitation gradient was tremendous over Philadelphia as only 0.64 inches fell at the Northeast Philadelphia Airport.||A total of 8.02 inches of rain fell at the Philadelphia International Airport on the 28th. The amount not only established a new record daily maximum rainfall for that date, but was also the most rainfall on record for any calendar day in Philadelphia. The previous record was set on September 16, 1999 during Tropical Storm Floyd and was 6.63 inches.  This torrential downpour also helped establish a new July monthly rainfall record of 13.24 inches in Philadelphia. The previous record was 10.42 inches set in 1994.",CSV
