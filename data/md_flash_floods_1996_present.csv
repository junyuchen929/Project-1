The unseasonably warm air was drawn northward around the circulation of a deepening storm west of the Appalachians late on the 18th and early on the 19th.  The melting snow and heavy rains caused widespread, and in some cases, catastrophic flooding and flash flooding on the 19th.Strong low-level southeast flow developed by late afternoon on the 18th.  Initially, colder temperatures in sheltered valleys slowed the rate of snow melt while the warm moist air mass attacked the snow pack at higher elevations.  By mid-evening, however, even lower elevations were warming rapidly.  Flash flooding began at around the same time as the onset of heavy pre-frontal rains.  These heavier showers fell repeatedly over the region between 0400 and 0800EST, causing acute and widespread flooding and flash flooding.  Some areas received between 2 and 4 inches of rain during this period.Some of the most pronounced damage occurred in Allegany Co, where an estimated $7 million in damage was reported from the initial floods alone.  Two permanent homes were destroyed, 20 had major damage, and 205 had minor damage.  Two mobile homes were destroyed, and 8 others had major damage; several apartments were flooded, and 32 businesses were damaged.  Washington Co estimated over $1 million dollars in damage from flood waters.  Five single-family homes had major damage; 2 had minor damage.  Eleven mobile homes in Funkstown sustained major damage, 13 had minor damage; 2 apartments had major damage and 3 minor damage.  An oil spill also occurred in Williamsport.",NA,PDC

The warm moist air mass contained temperatures in the upper 50s and lower 60s, along with relative humidity near 100 percent.  A deepening storm moving north through the Ohio Valley drew the subtropical air into the region.  Minor flash flooding began during the pre-dawn hours, but more significant flooding occurred with the passage of an intense and unusual squall line, which moved through between 0900 and 1200EST.  The squall line dumped rainfall amounts of 1.5 to 2.5 inches in less than 3 hours at any one location.  Streams quickly overflowed their banks, and water ponded quickly from clogged storm drains and saturated ground.Flash flooding, due to streams and creeks out of their banks, began in northern Montgomery, western Carroll, and much of Frederick Co around 0700EST.  The onset of heavy rains, between 0900 and 1000EST over the piedmont, and 1000 and 1200EST elsewhere, produced more substantial flash flooding.  In Frederick Co, flash floods caused mud slides, knocked down trees, and closed roads.  Numerous rescues were undertaken, mostly due to stranded vehicles.  At the height of the storm, 52 roads were closed.  Three hundred seventy-eight homes sustained flood-related damage.  Fortunately, there were no fatalities, but there were a number of minor injuries.  Rapid flooding of the Monocacy River (Frederick Co) caused problems, and there was flooding reported at Point of Rocks.  In Carroll Co, 75 acres were reported under water, and several homes were evacuated in Detour, a result of a flood-related HAZMAT incident.  Another oil spill also occurred at Owings Mills in Baltimore Co.In Montgomery Co, an elderly woman was in fair condition after her car was submerged along White's Ferry Road near Poolesville.  Numerous creeks and streams were out of their banks countywide, including Rock Creek near Kensington.  The flooded creek left large deposits of sediment in its wake.  In Prince George's Co, over a dozen cars were towed out of high water along federal highway 1, which was temporarily closed.Farther east, in the Baltimore vicinity, several water rescues were reported.  Just south of Baltimore City, Interstate 695 was closed briefly near Arbutus.  An automobile was swept away in Harford Co.",NA,PDC

The combustible situation produced a mesoscale low pressure system which focused the most substantial severe which focused the most substantial severe weather in north-central Maryland.   The episode featured five tornadoes, nearly a dozen instances of wind damage, and several large hail occurrences.The most concentrated damage was in and around Hagerstown.  Three separate tornadoes dropped from the same parent thunderstorm within moments of each other.  The first two caused considerable property damage between the town of Halfway and Hagerstown.  The third produced a track of mainly tree and underbrush damage from just south of the Washington County Regional Airport to the Maryland/Pennsylvania state line.  The first twister, which developed three miles south of Halfway, toppled and uprooted dozens of trees and blew down wires in the Tammany Manor neighborhood, as well as at the Hickory Elementary School.  The tornado saved its worst for the Valley Mall, where a portion of the roof was torn off and damage was noted at an anchor store's loading dock.  Another adjacent store had an electrical fire.More commercial damage occurred a few blocks north, along Wesel Boulevard, where the roofs of several vacant buildings were torn off.  Canopy tents at the Wal-Mart department store were flattened; the store's garden center had its greenhouse destroyed; many pieces of equipment, and plants and flowers, were also damaged.  An awning at a local automobile dealership was ripped off.  This tornado dissipated just southeast of the Washington Co. Detention Center - but not before knocking down trees along Interstate 81, temporarily closing one of the two travel lanes.Shortly before the first tornado lifted, a second touched down in the Greenbury Hills subdivision of Halfway, uprooting trees and ripping siding from a few homes.  This twister, on the ground for five miles, caused much of its damage over the western portion of Hagerstown before dissipating.  At the Potomac Center, 44 trees were uprooted, and another 40 were damaged.  Dozens more were snapped and uprooted at the nearby Carroll Heights/Hyde Park subdivision; trees were also uprooted and snapped at the Rest Haven Cemetery, with at least four fallen trees knocking over headstones.  Hundreds more trees were damaged at both the Hagerstown Business College and the nearby Fountain Head Country Club, whose golf course was closed for two days to clean up the debris.While eastern Washington Co was being pummelled, another cell was producing wind damage from southwestern through central Frederick Co.  Several trees were snapped and uprooted, and some homes sustained damage to shingles, siding, and porch supports, in Middletown.  More damage was noted between Jefferson and Buckeystown - another microburst - witnessed by residents as a rolling black cloud.  Damage included numerous trees snapped and uprooted, a destroyed cinder block outbuilding, and a damaged garage door.  Farther to the northeast, more trees were snapped, including one which fell onto a house near Libertytown.  A small tornado touched down just northeast of Frederick city, taking down about a half-dozen trees near the intersection of Gas House and Linganore Roads.  Intense lightning caused problems as well.  The radio transmission tower which serves the Frederick Co emergency operations center was knocked out, with damage reported to radio and telecommunications equipment.  Several homes were struck in the area, as was a fire department vehicle.Severe weather propagated eastward into Carroll and Baltimore Cos.  Damaging winds snapped and uprooted many trees in Westminster, including one which fell onto a home.  Two trees crashed through residents' roofs along state route 31 near Westminster.  Large hail the size of tennis balls caused scattered damage to homes and vehicles in Finksburg.  The heavy rains associated with the stronger cells caused flash flooding across portions of the Big Pipe Creek watershed in northern Carroll Co; several roads were temporarily closed near Taneytown where the Bear Branch overflowed its banks.  One road was washed out.  Lightning struck at least one home and barn, causing small fires and minor damage.Just west of the Baltimore/Carroll line (1 mile southwest of Fowblesburg), a small tornado knocked down several trees, some which fell onto a house, a camper, and a shed.  Sheet metal was stripped from the shed; the trees were severely twisted, according to the resident.  More trees or large limbs fell in Reisterstown (Baltimore Co) and in northern Howard Co.As events were winding down across northern Maryland, another severe storm moved out of east-central Virginia and into lower southern Maryland, causing damage in counties that had been struck the previous evening.

Other localized flooding was observed in Frederick Co.The Maryland State Highway Administration and local emergency management officials reported numerous road closures in these areas.  In Frederick Co, fifteen roads were closed due to high water.  More pronounced road closures were noted in lower southern Maryland and portions of east-central Maryland.Nuisance road closures (for instance, Davidsonville Road and Crownsville Road) occurred in the Annapolis area.  In St Mary's Co, at least two dozen roads were closed.  Most were secondary roads, but two were rural state highways (routes 5, 235, and 238).  A local NWS cooperative observer noted nearly 6 1/2 inches in a five-day period, with 3.96 inches from the nor'easter alone.  In Charles Co, six secondary roads were closed.Though no coastal flooding was observed, there was some minor overwash at Annapolis, Chesapeake Beach (Calvert Co), and Breton Beach (St Mary's Co).  Channelling northerly winds down the bay reduced the flood threat, especially since tides were astronomically high.  These same northerly winds, blowing at gale force, built waves in the Bay to 5 feet or more.

Highest totals, ranging from 3 to 5 inches, fell in lower southern Maryland, causing widespread flooding of low lying areas and small streams and creeks.  The nor'easter, coming on the heels of one just a week earlier, caused tides of 3 to 4 feet above normal from the Calvert Co/Anne Arundel Co line south to Point Lookout in extreme southeastern St Mary's Co; and along the lower tidal Potomac River along the Charles and St Mary's shoreline, including Cobb Island and St George Island.  A daily rainfall record was broken at Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI); the 1.65 inches that fell on the 4th broke the 78 year-old Baltimore area mark of 1.48 inches.Flooding was most pronounced in St Mary's Co.  During the peak of the storm, 26 roads were closed due the combination of wind and rain.  Nine roads were closed due to flooding alone.  State thoroughfares affected included routes 5, 237, 238, 243, and 271.Evacuations were initiated in Great Mills and on St George Island due to rapid increases in tide levels.  At least 200 residents were evacuated, including one 3 year-old boy who required a water rescue.  Four fire fighters were treated for hypothermia at St Mary's hospital.  Some cars were nearly submerged in low-lying areas.  In the Golden Beach neighborhood, Lake White overspilled its banks, and poor drainage contributed to the misery.  The dam at St Mary's Lake held; overflow problems were minimal.The sewage system serving Lexington Park failed due to the abnormally heavy flow of water which caused manholes to flood.  For example, the treatment plant, which normally has a flow of 3.5 million gallons in a two-day period, had a flow of nearly six times that much (18 million gallons) on the 4th and 5th.  Schools closed at noon on the 4th and didn't reopen until the 6th.Other minor sewage backups were reported farther north in Frederick and Carroll Cos.Inland flooding was less extensive in Charles and Calvert Cos, but a problem nonetheless.  In Charles Co, 25 roads were closed at the peak of the flooding; numerous vehicles were reportedly stranded throughout the county.  Hydrologic observers recorded up to 4 1/2 inches of rain.  Coastal flooding forced evacuations of Cobb Island; the island was cutoff from the mainland at around 0700EST on the 5th, with conditions returning to normal by 1600EST.Other coastal flooding affected Calvert Co, from Solomons Point to North Beach.  The moderate flooding extended into extreme southern Anne Arundel Co just north of North Beach.  Local officials in North Beach noted that up to one-half of the beach was pushed southward by the pounding waves; an outfall was trapped open by the action of the shifting sand, causing Bay water to inundate local roads and some establishments.  The degree of erosion was greater than that associated with the remnants of hurricane Fran in 1996.Minor flooding affected the Annapolis City Dock (MDZ014), but sandbags protected most establishments.  Around 1 foot of water covered the dock area.Other flooding across the state closed seven roads in Anne Arundel Co.  Across Washington Co, especially in and near Hagerstown, early snow quickly changed to heavy rain.  Minor flooding closed at least a dozen secondary and tertiary roads, and numerous basements were flooded.  Only minor flooding was observed in the remaining counties east of the mountains.The heavy rains may have contributed to an automobile accident in Westminster (Carroll Co) where three persons were killed in the two vehicles involved.The storm was accompanied by gusty winds, especially over and east of the piedmont.

The hurricane caused widespread flash flooding as storm totals averaged around ten inches, most of which fell in a twelve hour period from the early morning through the afternoon on the 16th.  The highest verifiable storm total was 14.00 inches in Chestertown (Kent County).  Based on Doppler Radar storm totals estimate similar amounts also fell across northern Queen Anne's County. Flooding along tidal sections of inland creeks and rivers were exacerbated during times of high tide.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period for most of the Eastern Shore.  Hundreds of roads and bridges were closed.  At one point there were 225 roads closed throughout the state.  About 450 people were evacuated from low lying areas, 300 in Cecil County.  Five people were seriously injured.  Dozens more were rescued from trapped vehicles.  A 32-year-old man died on September 19th near Centreville (Queen Anne's County) when he was ejected from his motorcycle while attempting to jump over a washed out bridge.  While the highest wind gusts in most areas were less than 60 mph, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees across the Eastern Shore.  About 17,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was restored by the 19th.  A state of emergency was declared on the 16th and all schools were closed. The preliminary damage estimate was 15.25 million dollars.  President Clinton declared all of the Maryland Eastern shore a disaster area.     Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a very large sized hurricane that d prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled just west of Chesapeake Bay on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the Western Shore, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front and then rode north along the boundary.  Light rain associated with Floyd started along the Eastern Shore on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived in the Eastern Shore just after midnight on the 16th.  Floyd was still offshore south of North Carolina.  Floyd made its initial landfall during the early morning hours of the 16th at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina and accelerated as it proceeded northeast.   Damaging east winds arrived on the Lower Eastern Shore by 9 a.m. EDT as the torrential rain continued.  Meanwhile a weakened Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick island, Delaware.  By noon on the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic, although damaging winds continued.  At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  By 5 p.m. EDT the torrential rain was over for the Eastern Shore.  But in some cases (especially in Cecil County), the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.  The strong winds persisted through the evening of the 16th.  Wind  gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easy for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. In Cecil County, flash flooding closed 62 roads at one point.  Twenty roads were still closed the morning of the 17th.  Infrastructure damage alone was nearly 1 million dollars.  Ninety-two homes and 78 businesses were severely damaged.  Hundreds others were flooded.  Hardest hit were North East and Elkton.  In North East,  the Little Northeast Creek flooded and the municipality almost became an island.  Evacuations started at 10 a.m. EDT as about 100 people sought shelter.  The northbound bridge on Maryland State Route 272 was washed away.  Two hundred homes were flooded.  Catherine Street was cratered and a 20-year-old man was injured when he fell into the hole.  Four tanks that contained 80,000 gallons of oil collapsed and began floating downstream.  In Elkton, the Big Elk Creek flooded the downtown business area.  The flood waters were 5 to 6 feet higher than ever seen.  The hospital had first floor flooding. The Commercial Plaza on Maryland State Route 213 was ruined.  It was expected to be closed for six weeks.  A 13-year-old boy was plucked from the Big Elk Creek.  Others were rescued from car tops.  Farther upstream the Big Elk Creek washed away a bridge in the Fair Hill National Resource Management Area.  In Earleville, the county dam was damaged by the bloated Scotchman Creek.  One hundred feet of Mill Lane was washed away and the 23 acre Mill Pond emptied.  Evacuations occurred in Conowingo, Elkton, North East, Octararo, Rising Sun and Sun Valley.  Four trailers were completely destroyed by flood waters in Conowingo.  The strong winds also knocked down numerous trees.  Several houses and vehicles were damaged.Kent County appeared to escape with the least amount of damage from Floyd.  Road closures began at 915 a.m. EDT.  Hardest hit were homes in Sandfield just outside of Millington (Queen Anne's County).   The only railroad service into Queen Anne's County was suspended after flooding along the Charles River crippled the railroad's trestles. There were voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas and also in some mobile home parks.  Many roads were also closed on Miller's Island. Queen Anne's County was one of the harder hit counties on the Eastern Shore by Floyd.  Water rescues started at 10 a.m. EDT and continued all day.  About 75 persons were evacuated to shelters. Fifty-five roads were closed during the height of the storm including major roadways such as U.S. Route 50 and Maryland State Routes 213, 291, 300, 304 and 313.  Two 29-year-old men were injured when their pickup truck fell  into a 30 foot by 30 foot hole on MD 304 near Centreville.  Thirty-four roads were closed by either heavy flooding or minor to moderate damage.  Twenty bridges or culverts were washed out or had substantial damage.  All roads that were not badly damaged were reopened Saturday afternoon the 18th.  All county roads were reopened by the 21st although eight bridges and three state roads were still closed.  The number of bridge closings was down to six on October 2nd.  In addition, fallen trees blocked about 70 roads throughout the county.  Most of the damage occurred in the northern half of the county.  The worst flood related property damage occurred on the Queen Anne's side of Millington along the Chester River. Forty homes were damaged, 15 of them in Sandtown had six foot high water marks on the first floor.  Ten homes and several businesses along the Tuckahoe Creek in Queen Anne were badly flooded.  Some persons were still displaced on October 9th.  Other townships that also were hit hard by flooding were Centreville, Church Hall and Sudlersville (The downtown area became an island.)  Damaging winds buffeted Kent Island starting at 9 a.m. EDT.  The Cloverfields Community was hardest hit with 100 homes damaged by the high winds and downed trees.  Traffic was backed up for 2.5 hours over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge when an empty tractor trailer ignored posted restrictions and blew over.  The Queen Anne County Library was also damaged by large trees.      In Caroline County, towns near rivers (Denton, Federalsburg, Greensboro and Hillsboro) bore the brunt of the damage.  Six roads and thirty bridges were in need of repairs.  About 20 people were in shelters throughout the county.  A dam break near Harmony closed Maryland State Route 16. Other dam failures or spillovers occurred on Lake Bonnie near Goldsboro, Crouse Mill in Tuckahoe State Park and Chambers Lake near Federalsburg. Three schools suffered water damage.  Large pieces of roadways collapsed on Maryland State Route 480 and Second Street in Denton.   Infrastructure damage alone was estimated as high as 2.5 million.  A truck driver was injured when his vehicle overturned on a flooded Maryland State Route 312.       In Talbot County, flooding forced the closure of numerous roads in Easton, St. Michael's and Oxford.  At 1040 a.m. EDT, a man hanging from a branch was rescued in Easton.  About 75 people went to shelters as citizens in low-lying areas were urged to evacuate.  On the Talbot County side of Queen Anne, severe damage occurred  to 10 homes, three businesses and 30 vehicles on Cannery Road.  The water was up to 10 feet high on the 16th and their was still up to six feet of water in the streets the next day. Downed trees caused about 3,000 homes and businesses to lose power in Easton, Saint Michael's and Trappe.  A wind gust to 50 mph was recorded in Royal Oak.Storm totals included 14.00 inches in Chestertown (Kent County), 12.00 inches in Rock Hall (Kent County),  11.20 inches in Federalsburg (Caroline County), 9.16 inches in Royal Oak Oak (Talbot County), 9.15 inches in Easton (Talbot County), 9.00 inches in North East (Cecil County) and 6.57 inches at the Conowingo Dam in Cecil County.

The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the Western Shore, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front and then rode north along the boundary.  Light rain associated with Floyd started along the Eastern Shore on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived in the Eastern Shore just after midnight on the 16th.  Floyd was still offshore south of North Carolina.  Floyd made its initial landfall during the early morning hours of the 16th at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina and accelerated as it proceeded northeast.   Damaging east winds arrived on the Lower Eastern Shore by 9 a.m. EDT as the torrential rain continued.  Meanwhile a weakened Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick island, Delaware.  By noon on the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic, although damaging winds continued.  At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  By 5 p.m. EDT the torrential rain was over for the Eastern Shore.  But in some cases (especially in Cecil County), the strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.  The strong winds persisted through the evening of the 16th.  Wind  gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easy for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. In Cecil County, flash flooding closed 62 roads at one point.  Twenty roads were still closed the morning of the 17th.  Infrastructure damage alone was nearly 1 million dollars.  Ninety-two homes and 78 businesses were severely damaged.  Hundreds others were flooded.  Hardest hit were North East and Elkton.  In North East,  the Little Northeast Creek flooded and the municipality almost became an island.  Evacuations started at 10 a.m. EDT as about 100 people sought shelter.  The northbound bridge on Maryland State Route 272 was washed away.  Two hundred homes were flooded.  Catherine Street was cratered and a 20-year-old man was injured when he fell into the hole.  Four tanks that contained 80,000 gallons of oil collapsed and began floating downstream.  In Elkton, the Big Elk Creek flooded the downtown business area.  The flood waters were 5 to 6 feet higher than ever seen.  The hospital had first floor flooding. The Commercial Plaza on Maryland State Route 213 was ruined.  It was expected to be closed for six weeks.  A 13-year-old boy was plucked from the Big Elk Creek.  Others were rescued from car tops.  Farther upstream the Big Elk Creek washed away a bridge in the Fair Hill National Resource Management Area.  In Earleville, the county dam was damaged by the bloated Scotchman Creek.  One hundred feet of Mill Lane was washed away and the 23 acre Mill Pond emptied.  Evacuations occurred in Conowingo, Elkton, North East, Octararo, Rising Sun and Sun Valley.  Four trailers were completely destroyed by flood waters in Conowingo.  The strong winds also knocked down numerous trees.  Several houses and vehicles were damaged.Kent County appeared to escape with the least amount of damage from Floyd.  Road closures began at 915 a.m. EDT.  Hardest hit were homes in Sandfield just outside of Millington (Queen Anne's County).   The only railroad service into Queen Anne's County was suspended after flooding along the Charles River crippled the railroad's trestles. There were voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas and also in some mobile home parks.  Many roads were also closed on Miller's Island. Queen Anne's County was one of the harder hit counties on the Eastern Shore by Floyd.  Water rescues started at 10 a.m. EDT and continued all day.  About 75 persons were evacuated to shelters. Fifty-five roads were closed during the height of the storm including major roadways such as U.S. Route 50 and Maryland State Routes 213, 291, 300, 304 and 313.  Two 29-year-old men were injured when their pickup truck fell  into a 30 foot by 30 foot hole on MD 304 near Centreville.  Thirty-four roads were closed by either heavy flooding or minor to moderate damage.  Twenty bridges or culverts were washed out or had substantial damage.  All roads that were not badly damaged were reopened Saturday afternoon the 18th.  All county roads were reopened by the 21st although eight bridges and three state roads were still closed.  The number of bridge closings was down to six on October 2nd.  In addition, fallen trees blocked about 70 roads throughout the county.  Most of the damage occurred in the northern half of the county.  The worst flood related property damage occurred on the Queen Anne's side of Millington along the Chester River. Forty homes were damaged, 15 of them in Sandtown had six foot high water marks on the first floor.  Ten homes and several businesses along the Tuckahoe Creek in Queen Anne were badly flooded.  Some persons were still displaced on October 9th.  Other townships that also were hit hard by flooding were Centreville, Church Hall and Sudlersville (The downtown area became an island.)  Damaging winds buffeted Kent Island starting at 9 a.m. EDT.  The Cloverfields Community was hardest hit with 100 homes damaged by the high winds and downed trees.  Traffic was backed up for 2.5 hours over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge when an empty tractor trailer ignored posted restrictions and blew over.  The Queen Anne County Library was also damaged by large trees.      In Caroline County, towns near rivers (Denton, Federalsburg, Greensboro and Hillsboro) bore the brunt of the damage.  Six roads and thirty bridges were in need of repairs.  About 20 people were in shelters throughout the county.  A dam break near Harmony closed Maryland State Route 16. Other dam failures or spillovers occurred on Lake Bonnie near Goldsboro, Crouse Mill in Tuckahoe State Park and Chambers Lake near Federalsburg. Three schools suffered water damage.  Large pieces of roadways collapsed on Maryland State Route 480 and Second Street in Denton.   Infrastructure damage alone was estimated as high as 2.5 million.  A truck driver was injured when his vehicle overturned on a flooded Maryland State Route 312.       In Talbot County, flooding forced the closure of numerous roads in Easton, St. Michael's and Oxford.  At 1040 a.m. EDT, a man hanging from a branch was rescued in Easton.  About 75 people went to shelters as citizens in low-lying areas were urged to evacuate.  On the Talbot County side of Queen Anne, severe damage occurred  to 10 homes, three businesses and 30 vehicles on Cannery Road.  The water was up to 10 feet high on the 16th and their was still up to six feet of water in the streets the next day. Downed trees caused about 3,000 homes and businesses to lose power in Easton, Saint Michael's and Trappe.  A wind gust to 50 mph was recorded in Royal Oak.Storm totals included 14.00 inches in Chestertown (Kent County), 12.00 inches in Rock Hall (Kent County),  11.20 inches in Federalsburg (Caroline County), 9.16 inches in Royal Oak Oak (Talbot County), 9.15 inches in Easton (Talbot County), 9.00 inches in North East (Cecil County) and 6.57 inches at the Conowingo Dam in Cecil County.

The highest verifiable storm total was 14.00 inches in Chestertown (Kent County).  Based on Doppler Radar storm totals estimate similar amounts also fell across northern Queen Anne's County. Flooding along tidal sections of inland creeks and rivers were exacerbated during times of high tide.  The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period for most of the Eastern Shore.  Hundreds of roads and bridges were closed.  At one point there were 225 roads closed throughout the state.  About 450 people were evacuated from low lying areas, 300 in Cecil County.  Five people were seriously injured.  Dozens more were rescued from trapped vehicles.  A 32-year-old man died on September 19th near Centreville (Queen Anne's County) when he was ejected from his motorcycle while attempting to jump over a washed out bridge.

Storm winds weakened and the speed of the line slowed as it moved south and east of Frederick and Carroll Counties.  The resulting line of showers that moved into Prince Georges, Anne Arundel, and Baltimore Counties produced copious amounts of rainfall and led to flash flooding.  South of Hagerstown in Washington County, winds in excess of 55 MPH downed several trees.  Eight trees were downed onto Spielman Road, blocking the street for 90 minutes.  Power lines were downed onto Sharpsburg Pike and Tilghmanton Road.  A one mile wide and two mile long area just south of Boonsboro bore the brunt of concentrated downburst winds between 60 and 70 MPH.  Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, a satellite dish was damaged, a tree fell onto a home causing minor damage, and tin roof sheets were torn from a barn, resulting in $5000 in losses.  Up to 100 customers lost power as a direct result of the storm, including residents of Sharpsburg and Keedysville.  A gustnado, or squall line tornado, formed just north of the this path of concentrated damage, about 2 miles south of Boonsboro.  The gustnado had a damage path which was 1.5 miles long and 60 yards wide, produced $75,000 in damage, and was of F1 strength.  Most of the damage from the gustnado was concentrated in the Route 67, Appleton road, and Netz Road area, knocking out power to 500 residents.  The twister passed across a dairy farm along Appleton Road and ripped a third of the roof off a milking barn, stripped siding and trim from farm buildings, and carried 8 calf igloos and other debris up to one quarter mile away.  Some of the the beams from the milking barn roof were driven up to 2 feet into the ground after coming to rest on the next farm.  An estimated $5000 damage was done to the farm.  Farther down Appleton Road, the gustnado inflicted minor damage to a barn, a garage, and a home.  Two pine trees were uprooted nearby.  Along Netz Road, two homes lost shutters and another had damage to a storm door.  Trees were snapped or uprooted, and a trampoline standing up sideways was wrapped around a tree.  The gustnado also peeled back the metal roof of a Dogstreet Road house, allowing rain water to damage furniture and electronics.  Next, the line of thunderstorms moved into southwest Frederick County.  Trees were downed in the Wolfsville and Middletown area.  Heavy downpours flooded low lying roads and farmland throughout the county.  Heavy downpours were a contributing factor in several accidents in Frederick County.  Two accidents occurred on Braddock Mountain at Interstate 70, three accidents occurred on Route 340, and one accident was reported on both Highway 17 and 85.  The storm moved into Carroll County and downed several trees and power lines, sending 8000 residents into the dark.  In the Westminster area, tree debris and telephone lines covered northbound Highway 97, closing it for 2 hours.  Cows got loose along the road after a fence was damaged, forcing county police to stage a roundup.  Over two inches of rain fell in Westminster in one hour.  Trees and power lines were also downed on Highway 97 near Union Mills.  The Union Mills Homestead was damaged after two red maple trees dating back to the Civil War fell onto the miller's house.  Maple and apple trees surrounding the property were split or uprooted. Downed trees and power lines blocked Saw Mill Road for several hours.  Finksburg reported 2.7 inches of rain and 50 MPH winds.

Between 6:30 PM and 8:30 PM EDT, 4.6 inches of rain fell at Fort McHenry.In Southern Baltimore County, streets and streams flooded in Owings Mills and Randallstown.  Several motorists had to be rescued from quickly rising water.  The deluge of rain closed the Maryland State Fair at Timonium on its first night of business.  In Woodlawn, a storm drain and culvert near Dead Run Creek swelled with water and overflowed into the parking lot of a car dealership on Security Boulevard.  In less than 9 minutes, four feet of water poured onto 70 trucks, totalling 30 cars and resulting in $30 million in damages.  Dried mud and twigs were found inside the automobiles after the water subsided.  Flooding closed sections of Interstate 83 in Baltimore County and in the city of Baltimore.  Water poured off Interstate 83 and quickly reached a depth of 6 feet in a health club parking lot off Clipper Mill Road.  Forty cars in the parking lot were damaged, and most of the cars were moved several yards by the force of the water.  In Arbutus, occupants of 4 cars at the intersection of Leeds Avenue and Maiden Choice Lane had to be rescued after 4 feet of water poured into the street.  Eight people were rescued at the intersection of Security Boulevard and Gwynn Oak Avenue around 7:00 PM EDT after cars became stalled in rapidly moving flood waters.  Boston and Aliceanna Streets in Canton and Clipper Mill Road in Woodbury were also impassable.  Several flights were delayed or cancelled at Baltimore Washington International Airport (BWI).  The city of Baltimore reported numerous roads under water and several stalled vehicles and water rescues.  So many streets flooded that officials asked drivers to stay put until the water receded.  Over 17,000 residents of the city lost power as a direct result of the storm, and hundreds of basements flooded.  Hardest hit were areas near Jones Falls along Interstate 83.  An apartment complex next to Jones Falls was inundated with water and cars in the parking lot were floating.  The Northwest Ice Rink was inundated with water, and motorists near Camden yards waited on the roofs of their cars to be rescued from waist-high water.  A building collapsed around 9:00 PM EDT on Wicomico Street, and rushing water blasted a hole in another home.  Rain and mud on railroad tracks and water in the Howard Street tunnel two miles south of Baltimore's Penn Station delayed MARC and Amtrack commuter trains between Washington and Baltimore.  It rained so hard that medevac helicopters from the Shock Trauma Center at University Hospital had to be grounded. In Anne Arundel County, Brock Bridge, Mill Creek, Race, River, Rideout, and Severn Side Roads were closed by high water.  Part of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway was also closed.  During the height of the storm, 1600 county residents lost power.  Homes on Potomac Road in Edgewater had knee-deep water flowing inside which ruined furniture on the first floor and flooded basements and garages.  High water closed a part of Route 450 between South Haven Road and Eagle Boulevard, Mayo and Washington Road, and several roads in the London Towne area.  Heavy rains also caused a failure of erosion control measures at an Annapolis construction site on Gibralter Avenue, sending muddy water streaming down city streets toward Weems Creek.

In Woodlawn, a storm drain and culvert near Dead Run Creek swelled with water and overflowed into the parking lot of a car dealership on Security Boulevard.  In less than 9 minutes, four feet of water poured onto 70 trucks, totalling 30 cars and resulting in $30 million in damages.  Dried mud and twigs were found inside the automobiles after the water subsided.  Flooding closed sections of Interstate 83 in Baltimore County and in the city of Baltimore.  Water poured off Interstate 83 and quickly reached a depth of 6 feet in a health club parking lot off Clipper Mill Road.  Forty cars in the parking lot were damaged, and most of the cars were moved several yards by the force of the water.  In Arbutus, occupants of 4 cars at the intersection of Leeds Avenue and Maiden Choice Lane had to be rescued after 4 feet of water poured into the street.  Eight people were rescued at the intersection of Security Boulevard and Gwynn Oak Avenue around 7:00 PM EDT after cars became stalled in rapidly moving flood waters.  Boston and Aliceanna Streets in Canton and Clipper Mill Road in Woodbury were also impassable.  Several flights were delayed or cancelled at Baltimore Washington International Airport (BWI).  The city of Baltimore reported numerous roads under water and several stalled vehicles and water rescues.  So many streets flooded that officials asked drivers to stay put until the water receded.  Over 17,000 residents of the city lost power as a direct result of the storm, and hundreds of basements flooded.  Hardest hit were areas near Jones Falls along Interstate 83.  An apartment complex next to Jones Falls was inundated with water and cars in the parking lot were floating.  The Northwest Ice Rink was inundated with water, and motorists near Camden yards waited on the roofs of their cars to be rescued from waist-high water.

In Anne Arundel County, Brock Bridge, Mill Creek, Race, River, Rideout, and Severn Side Roads were closed by high water.  Part of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway was also closed.  During the height of the storm, 1600 county residents lost power.  Homes on Potomac Road in Edgewater had knee-deep water flowing inside which ruined furniture on the first floor and flooded basements and garages.  High water closed a part of Route 450 between South Haven Road and Eagle Boulevard, Mayo and Washington Road, and several roads in the London Towne area.  Heavy rains also caused a failure of erosion control measures at an Annapolis construction site on Gibralter Avenue, sending muddy water streaming down city streets toward Weems Creek.  Four inches of rain fell in Annapolis in only 90 minutes.","Significant flooding of low lying areas and streams, cars and roads submerged",PDC

One thunderstorm produced a devastating F3 tornado which was on the ground for 17.5 miles from College Park in Prince George's County to just east of Columbia in Howard County.  Multiple vortices were reported with the tornado at times.  The tornado first touched down in Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park just west of Hyattsville.  It rapidly strengthened to an F3 tornado with winds up to 200 MPH.  The damage path ranged in width from 100 to 200 yards.  The tornado crossed the intersection of Adelphi Road and University Boulevard into the western campus of the University of Maryland.  Ten trailers being used as a temporary office for the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute were completely destroyed by the twister.  Debris from the trailers such as video tapes and pieces of paper were found up to 60 miles away in Northern Baltimore and Harford Counties in addition to extreme southeast Pennsylvania.  Four of the six people inside the trailers were injured, one seriously.  One staff member was thrown free of the destruction and was found in a dumpster nearby.  Another person dug their hands into the carpet and held on as their feet were being pulled up in the air by the tornado.  The other four occupants, including one child, took shelter under desks and survived.  Two University of Maryland students who were visiting their father who worked in the trailers left by car shortly before the tornado hit.  The two sisters, ages 20 and 23, were killed when the tornado picked up their car outside of Denton Hall and threw it either around or over an eight-story dorm.  They died instantly when their car crashed into a wooded area 300 yards from the road.  Most of the other buildings on the campus in the path of the storm were made of brick and suffered only minor to moderate damage, such as Denton Hall Dormitory, Easton Hall Dormitory and Dining Hall, and the President's Mansion.  A parking lot outside of Denton Hall full of cars was also hit by the tornado.  At least 200 vehicles in the parking lot were damaged, including at least 100 that were blown into and onto other vehicles.  At least twenty cars were totaled and one car was partially ripped apart.  The woods behind the parking lot were nearly flattened.  The bubble roof of the football practice facility near Byrd Stadium was removed.  Forty-eight people on campus, including 25 students, were injured by flying debris as the twister downed trees and ripped pieces of siding and roofing off buildings.  In addition, residential areas near the campus, including the University Courtyard Apartments sustained damage.  A total of 3000 students were left temporarily homeless after two dorms and an off-campus housing unit were evacuated due to storm damage.  During the recovery effort, a 78-year-old firefighter who responded to the tragedy at the University died of a heart attack shortly after returning from the scene. The tornado moved north-northeast off the campus and crossed University Boulevard at the intersection of Metzerott Road.  The steeple of a church was removed and cars were flipped near the intersection.  Power lines and trees were also downed.  The twister continued through Paint Branch Stream Valley Park where it downed numerous trees.   The tornado weakened to F2 strength before it crossed Interstate 95/495 just west of the Route 1 interchange.  It was remarkable that even though the highway was filled with bumper to bumper rush hour traffic, the only damage reported was a flipped tractor trailer.  The next area hit by the tornado was the community of Cherry Hill.  Several trees and power lines were downed onto roads and houses just west of Baltimore Avenue, including the Chestnut Hills subdivision.  Several businesses along Route 1 sustained minor damage, and three additional buildings lost portions of their roofs.  Three employees of a business in the Chestnut Hills Shopping Center were injured by flying glass after the windows on the front of the store were shattered.  The tornado moved across the National Agricultural Research Center and caused over $40 million dollars in damage.  Thirty greenhouses were damaged and several long term studies inside were destroyed.  Fifteen other buildings west of Route 1 suffered minor to moderate damage.  Numerous trees, including a row of historic willow oaks, were downed.  Over 65 vehicles in the employee parking lot were damaged by flying debris.  Eleven of these vehicles were totaled.  Just north of the research center, ""stunning"" tree and power line damage was reported at the intersection of Sellman and Montgomery Roads.  The tornado tracked across Powder Mill Road and ripped the roof off an office building at the intersection of Cedar Lane.

There was a temporary ban on harvesting shellfish along Chesapeake Bay because of the excessive runoff.  Some tomato, corn, watermelon and cantaloupe crops were destroyed. It was estimated that 30,000 chickens were also killed by the effects of Irene.||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread the Eastern Shore during the afternoon and early evening of the 27th and persisted into the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged 50 to 60 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening and late night of the 27th. The second peak occurred during the late morning and early afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. The rain associated with Irene overspread the Eastern Shore between 7 a.m. EDT and Noon EDT on the 27th, fell at its heaviest from the late afternoon of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended around Noon EDT on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 6 to 12 inches and caused widespread field and roadway flooding. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related county entries were combined into one under flood events.  ||On August 25, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley declared a state of emergency in preparation for Irene. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge was closed to vehicular traffic. In Queen Anne's County, in Queenstown, an 88-year-old woman was killed when a tree fell on a chimney, sending bricks through the glass roof of a sun room where she had taken refuge since it had emergency power. About 13,000 utility customers lost power.   Sections of Maryland State Routes 18, 19 and 802 were also closed because of high winds and or debris on roadways. In Cecil County, sections of Maryland State Routes 273, 213 and 272 were closed. About seventy-percent of all Delmarva Power customers lost power. In Kent County, multiple parts of Maryland State Routes 20 and 445 were closed. In all twenty-seven roadways were closed by downed trees. In Talbot County, debris closed Maryland State Route 662C. About 100 properties and 50 roadways and bridges were damaged by the flooding and wind. In Caroline County, sections of Maryland State Routes 287, 313, 31 and 311 were among twenty roadways that were closed. Two dozen homes were damaged by the flooding and wind. About 5,500 homes and businesses lost power.  ||The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 61 mph in Salisbury (Wicomico County), 60 mph in Tolchester Beach (Kent County) and 51 mph at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport.||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th and then proceeded to the northnortheast and went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th.",NA,CSV

Soil conditions were wetter than usual for late June leading into this event and made it easier for flooding to occur. Event precipitation totals reached two to three inches, especially from northern Queen Anne's County north to the Pennsylvania border.  Lighter showers arrived around sunrise on the 27th. Precipitation remained fairly light until late in the afternoon. The showers and thunderstorms ended by the middle of the evening on the 27th. The heavy precipitation was caused by an anomalously strong low pressure that moved through the Ohio Valley on the 27th. Its warm front moved northeast through the Eastern Shore during that evening as a secondary low pressure system formed along it. Thunderstorms with the very heavy rain developed in the warm sector south of the front and moved through the Eastern Shore. In addition to the flooding, isolated wind damage also occurred. ||The heavy rain on the 27th continued the trend of a very wet month of June across the Eastern Shore and Maryland as a whole. The June Maryland statewide average precipitation of 8.94 inches ranked as the third wettest on record dating back to 1895.","Thunderstorms with very heavy rain caused flash flooding and poor drainage flooding in southern Cecil County.
