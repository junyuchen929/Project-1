Damage estimates from all the flooding are listed in the next entry.In Gloucester County, 15 families were evacuated from the Willow Trailer Park by boat in West Deptford after the Woodbury Creek overflowed.  In Salem County, the heavy rain caused a cellar to collapse in a Woodstown Road home.  In Cumberland County, the Cohansey River flooded in Bridgeton behind city hall.  Flooding was also reported along the Maurice River.  In Camden County, flooding along the Cooper River forced the closure of the Admiral Wilson Boulevard.  In Burlington County several homes along the Rancocas Creek were evacuated in Mount Laurel.   Above normal tides along the Delaware River and Bay contributed to the problem in the latter three counties.  Also in Burlington County the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek flooded in Pemberton forcing the evacuation of one family and flooding along the South Branch of the Rancocas Creek forced the voluntary evacuations of several other families in Southampton.  In Mercer County flooding along the Stony Brook resulted in fourteen water rescues including six children in Princeton.  In Monmouth County creek flooding caused several road closures in Freehold.  In Somerset County, one of the most dramatic rescues occurred at 2 p.m. on the 19th as a father and son were recovered from the top of their minivan that was stuck in the flooded Lamington River.  In Middlesex County U.S. Route 1 was closed in Woodbridge.  In Warren County a mudslide closed County Road 609 in Knowlton. Flash flooding of a nearby stream in Allamuchy forced the evacuation of a school.  In Hunterdon County, a Lambertville Public School was evacuated at 2 p.m. when flooding from a nearby creek started inundating the building.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.

In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.  Highest reported wind gusts were 62 mph in Browns Mills (Burlington County), 58 mph at the Commodore Barry Bridge (Gloucester County), 52 mph in Luke's Bay (Atlantic County), Waretown (Ocean County) and Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 47 mph in High Point (Sussex County), 44 mph in Trenton (Mercer County) and 40 mph in MIllville (Cumberland County).Precipitation storm totals (done from north to south with up to the four highest reported amounts per county) included: In Sussex County 8.50 inches in Highland Lakes, 8.15 inches in High Point, 8.00 inches in Wawayanda and 7.80 inches in Wantage.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.

In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.  Highest reported wind gusts were 62 mph in Browns Mills (Burlington County), 58 mph at the Commodore Barry Bridge (Gloucester County), 52 mph in Luke's Bay (Atlantic County), Waretown (Ocean County) and Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 47 mph in High Point (Sussex County), 44 mph in Trenton (Mercer County) and 40 mph in MIllville (Cumberland County).Precipitation storm totals (done from north to south with up to the four highest reported amounts per county) included: In Sussex County 8.50 inches in Highland Lakes, 8.15 inches in High Point, 8.00 inches in Wawayanda and 7.80 inches in Wantage. In Warren County 8.85 inches at the Belvidere Bridge, 8.01 inches in Blairstown and 7.10 inches in Columbia.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT.

In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as ""It's gone."", ""It's totaled."", ""It's like nothing we've seen before."" were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.   Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.

There was still some freezing rain in Sussex County.  The heaviest rain fell across eastern New Jersey where rainfall rates of an inch per hour lasted for two to three hours.  This caused flooding of some streams in Monmouth, Camden and Atlantic Counties and precipitated a mud slide that destroyed one unit of a condominium complex in Highlands (Monmouth County).  The occupants of the unit suffered natural gas inhalation, but were otherwise unharmed.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates indicated a band of very heavy rain fell diagonally across the state from Millville northeast through western Atlantic County, southern Burlington County, western Ocean County and most of Monmouth County.On the evening of the 2nd, as one low pressure system headed into the Great Lakes, a second low pressure system formed along its frontal boundary along the coastal plains of the South Atlantic States.  Not only did this second low pressure system increase the pressure gradient (or surface pressure difference between it and a strong high pressure system over the Canadian Maritimes), but it also brought heavy rain into the state.  Urban and poor drainage flooding occurred.  This was exacerbated near the coast ( the rain was also heavier) by coinciding with the morning high tide.  In Highlands, a 20 foot by 5 foot section of South Linden Avenue caved in and sent wet earth and trees into a retention wall behind the Highland Shore Condominium Complex.

As an icy coating developed on road surfaces below freezing, some significant traffic accidents occurred across the region from midnight through 3 am.

Doppler Radar Storm total estimates reached around 15 inches along the Sussex/Morris County border.  Two to three inches of rain fell per hour in the strongest storms and caused considerable, widespread and devastating flooding across southeastern Sussex County and western Morris County. Mud and rock slides exacerbated the damage. This was approximately a one in a thousand year event. About 2,700 homes and businesses were flooded. Eight houses were totally destroyed, about one hundred suffered major damage.  About 2,600 persons were evacuated in Morris, Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon Counties, including children at a day camp in Byram Township (Sussex County). In Morris County, three bridges were destroyed, two dams were badly damaged, four others suffered some damage and about two dozen roads were closed or damaged. The torrential rain caused a record rise in Lake Hopatcong and lakeside flooding in Jefferson and Roxbury Townships (Morris County). The record level of Lake Hoptacong led to downstream flooding along the Musconetcong River through Warren and Hunterdon Counties. In Sussex County: three dams were destroyed, six other dams were damaged, three bridges were destroyed, eight others were closed or damaged and three roads were swept away.  Countless others were closed. Newton's water mains were ruptured by the flash flooding cutting off its main water supply. A temporary hookup was made to Sparta's water system. It might be up to four years before the lines will be repaired. Water restrictions were placed in effect for those two communities. In addition, residents in Newton, Ogdensburg, Sparta (all Sussex County) and Jefferson and Roxbury (Morris County) were advised to boil their water before consuming it.  The greatest damage to any business occurred to Compac Corporation in Stanhope (Sussex County) after the Furnace Pond Dam failed on Sunday the 13th. The Musconetcong River crashed into the building and flooded the entire first floor. Throughout the area persons were rescued after their vehicles drove into the water on collapsed roadways. Miraculously no serious injuries occurred. Around an inch of additional rain fell on Monday the 14th. This continued the fear of further mudslides, dam collapses and flooding, especially along the Musconetcong River. The additional rain also caused flooding along the main stem of the Passaic River in Morris County. A state of emergency was declared for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 14th. A federal disaster area declaration was issued by President Clinton for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 16th.  Damage was estimated at 179 million dollars. About 12,000 GPU Energy customers lost power. The only death occurred when a 58-year-old man's kayak overturned on the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County on the 15th and he apparently drowned. **** IN SUSSEX COUNTY ****Sussex County bore the brunt of the storm with about 1,700 homes and businesses damaged. About half of the monetary damage occurred to roads, dams, bridges and public buildings. No place was hit harder than Sparta Township. Devastating flooding occurred near and along the Glen Brook and Wallkill River. The raging Glen Brook carved a canyon in Sparta Glen (a township park), uprooted trees and brought boulders down from Edison and Sparta Mountains. The brook also tore the water mains of Newton's water supply from Morris Lake. The two mains were torn for 1.5 miles. Repairs were expected to take up to four years. The lower section of Glen Road (County Route 620) fell into the Sparta Glen. It continued to collapse through Monday (the 14th). A 50 foot by 50 foot and 20 foot deep hole was created where the road was. Repairs were expected to take one year and damage to Sparta Glen was estimated at 2 million dollars. The torrential rains filled ponds and lakes and caused dam failures.  Both the Edison Pond and Seneca Dams were destroyed. In the latter, the 25 acre lake completely drained leaving behind dead fish. The Sparta and Hawthorne Lake Dams were damaged. Three hundred tons of gravel was used to shore the Fox Trail Lake Dam. One hundred homes were evacuated near the dam.  Mudslides down Sparta and Edison Mountains through the 14th covered County Route 517 (Main Street), the tracks of the New York-Susquehanna and Western Railroad and the Eagle's Nest Wastewater pump station. About 200 persons along Main Street were evacuated through Monday (the 14th) out of fear of further mudslides. Slow service along the railroad was restored that afternoon. The road was totally repaired in early October. In addition to Glen Road and the Glen Road Bridge, the flash flooding totally swept away sections of  Edison Road and Old Forge River Road and totally destroyed the Seneca Lake Bridge. Other bridges were damaged including the Main Street, Station Road, Park Street, Morris Lake and the bridge near Arapaho Trail.  Persons living on Old Forge River Road and Morris Lake Road only access to the outside world was via foot bridges. Temporary bridges were reopened by August 26th. The bridge repair near Arapaho Trail was completed on September 25th. Prior to that repair, it took residents and school buses over 45 minutes to reach the downtown areas of Sparta (normally a 10 minute trip). Most of the home damage occurred along Main Street and Glen Road. Three homes in the township were destroyed, seven were deemed uninhabitable and fifty other were damaged.  In Stanhope Borough, the largest singular loss occurred when the Musconetcong River Dam and the Furnace Pond Dam were damaged. The drainage conduit on the Furnace Pond Dam was eroded to three times its normal size when a large concrete chunk broke away. It increased the outflow along the Musconetcong River. The river rose from five feet to twenty feet. The river normally flows underneath the Compac Corporation's building. But the sudden rise ripped away a bank that normally channeled the flow away from the first floor. Instead it flowed straight into the first floor of the building. The water reached six feet high and shifted large amounts of inventory, pushed 2,000 rolls of paper out of the building  and drenched thousands of dollars of equipment. A forty-two inch diameter tree became stuck within the first floor. About 1,800 feet of the parking lot was ripped away. The structural integrity of the building was intact, but all of the company's machinery was damaged. Damage was expected to be in the millions. Production resumed in mid-September. Flood damage also occurred to the nearby Isolatek International Company, but was not as substantial. A few other businesses in Stanhope and Netcong (Morris County) suffered minor damage. The Kelly Place Bridge was damaged and not reopened until September 4th. The New Jersey State Route 183 bridge was also closed because it was flooded, but it was not damaged. In Ogdensburg Borough, three bridges over the Wallkill River were badly damaged (Corkhill Road, Kennedy Avenue and Bridge Street) and closed. About 200 persons were evacuated. These closings either isolated families (they had to walk across makeshift foot bridges) or forced them to go into the next township to reach their homes. Two were still closed in early October. Two roads were closed because the Wallkill River tore away the asphalt. One of them, the Corkhill Road Tunnel was closed indefinitely. Four homes had water damage up to their second floor. A water main on Corkhill Road was breached. This forced the borough to declare a state of  emergency because of  low water supply. It was repaired on Tuesday (the 15th),In Byram Township, the failure of the Seneca Lake Dam led to the destruction of the Tomahawk Lake Dam and the Tomahawk Trail Bridge (near the Sparta border). The Tomahawk Water Recreation Park was destroyed.  The Lake Drive Bridge near Lake Lackawanna was closed indefinitely. The Kelly Place Bridge was also damaged. Three hundred families in the Brookwood Neighborhood along River Road near the Musconetcong River were evacuated on Monday (the 14th). Hundreds of children were evacuated on Monday from the Jefferson Lake Day Camp because of the unknown integrity of a nearby dam.  In Hardyston Township, About 20 families were evacuated from around Summit Lake. The dams around Summit Lake, Tamarack Lake and Lake Girard were damaged, but remained intact. The Tamarack Lake Dam was aided by 1,000 sandbags. New Jersey State Route 23 was closed in Stockholm. The township estimated property damage at nearly one million dollars.  In Newton Town, a strip mall was submerged. But the largest problem was the loss of its two water mains from Morris Lake. It supplied 80 percent of the town's water. Half of the town lost its water instantaneously. The town set up four 5,000 gallon water tankers to distribute water. Many businesses were closed on Monday the 14th. A temporary connection to Sparta's water supply was completed on Tuesday the 15th. But it was estimated that it will take from 1 to 4 years to re-establish its own water supply at a cost of up to 3 million dollars. In Franklin Borough, about 130 persons were evacuated along the Wallkill River and Franklin Pond. County Route 517 into Sparta Township was closed because of mudslides. Elsewhere in Sussex County, a few roads were closed due to flooding in Frankford Township, Hamburg Borough, Lafayette Township and Wantage Township. About a dozen businesses suffered flood damage in Franklin and Hamburg Boroughs and  Sparta Township. Farms were flooded along the Wallkill River. Saturday's storm totals included 14.11 inches in Sparta, 6.84 inches in Hamburg, 4.33 inches in Stockholm, 2.84 inches in Vernon, 2.47 inches in Wantage, 2.08 inches in Sussex and 1.18 inches in Andover. On Monday the 14th, 1.15 inches fell in Andover and 0.71 inches in Andover.**** IN MORRIS COUNTY ****In Morris County, the unprecedented rainfall caused a record rise on Lake Hoptacong as well as flash flooding across the western part of the county. Flooding along the Rockaway River then pushed downstream toward and beyond the Boonton Reservoir. Flooding also occurred around Lake Shawnee and was exacerbated by damage to its dam. About 1,000 homes and businesses were damaged. Two houses were destroyed, 75 suffered major damage while 727 others suffered minor damage. About two dozen county bridges and roads were damaged. Three bridges were destroyed. Hundreds of roads were closed including the much traveled New Jersey State Route 15. Vehicles drove into flood waters after several roadways collapsed. About 150 persons were rescued from flood waters. About 400 persons were evacuated, mainly from locations near Lake Hopatcong and Lake Shawnee. Damage in the county was estimated at 12 million dollars.The hardest hit municipality in Morris County was Jefferson Township. The heaviest rain in the county fell over this township with Doppler Radar storm total estimates of 15 inches. The township suffered flooding from three fronts: Lake Hopatcong, Lake Shawnee and the Rockaway River and its tributaries. Lake Hopatcong rose nearly twelve feet on Saturday (the 12th) to its highest level in 114 years of record. At 6 a.m. EDT on Sunday (the 13th), the lake was 34 inches above the dam that spills into the Musconetcong River (in Roxbury Township). The previous record was set in 1955. The rise in Lake Hopatcong flooded the basements of lakeside homes. Fish were found in the basements. The lake also lifted boats above fixed docks and eventually pulled them under water. Hundreds of docks and dozens of boats were pulled under water. Other boats sunk. Boat lines were cut in the hopes of stopping boats from sinking. Sections of docks, propane tanks and lawn furniture were floating in the lake. The State Police Marine Bureau  in Great Cove was flooded. After the rain ended, a boating ban was placed in effect to prevent damage to boats by the debris and further lakefront home damage from waves. A swimming ban was also in effect due to goose droppings that streamed into the lake, oil escaping from sunken boats and outflow from nearby septic tanks. A boil drinking water advisory was issued by both Jefferson and Roxbury Townships. The Lake Shawnee Dam was badly damaged. The lake engulfed homes, damaged boats and tore off driveways. Residents were evacuated from around the lake. The loosened ground helped a tree crash onto a house near the lake. The torrential rain caused flash flooding along the Rockaway River and its tributaries. The Dover-Milton Road Bridge and two bridges on Taylor Road between County Route 699 and New Jersey State Route 15 were destroyed. They were reopened by the 28th of August. Bridges on Lower Berkshire Valley Road, Russia Road and Lorettacong Trail were closed due to roadway washouts. Vehicles drove into flood waters. Boulders, tree stumps and tires littered roadways. New Jersey State Route 15 was closed in several locations because of either flooding or rock slides. The worst one occurred toward Interstate 80. The state route was reopened on the 13th by using the shoulder on the south side of the highway. Flooding was so high on Espanong Road that a dog was rescued from a roof. Roads along Weldon Brook were also flooded. Several township dams (Lake Winona, Swannanoa, Hartung and No Name #51) showed signs of erosion and wear, but held. In Roxbury Township, all 160 lakeside (Hopatcong) homes had water encroaching upon the docks. Forty-eight homes had either interior flood or structural damage. Two businesses along the lake were badly damaged. Berkshire Valley Road was closed. In Mount Arlington Borough, flooding near the lake started at 10 a.m. EDT. About 50 homes were evacuated along the lake.  In Mount Olive Township, the worst flooding occurred on Sunday the 13th and Monday the 14th after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged. The rising Musconetcong River changed its course and flooded the Tilcon Quarry. The quarry became a 75 acre lake. Two bridges were closed between the township and Netcong Borough. As a precaution, New Jersey Transit canceled service between Mount Olive Township and Hackettstown on the 14th. The fortunate diversion of the river into the active quarry prevented flood damage from occurring farther downstream in Warren and Hunterdon Counties. It is expected to take several months to dry the Tilcon Quarry. About five homes along the river were evacuated on the 14th. A couple of businesses along the river in Netcong Borough were flooded. In Washington Township, the East Avenue Bridge (over the Musconetcong River) into Hackettstown was closed through the morning of the 15th. Elsewhere, in Rockaway Township, New Jersey State Route 15 was also closed near Mase Mountain as trees, boulders and dirt washed across the roadway. Several families were evacuated after flood waters ripped away a 30 foot chunk of the foundation under Mountain View Manor. There were wet basements throughout the township. Even though the rain was lighter, flooding along the Rockaway River extended downstream from Jefferson Township. In Wharton Borough, the Washington Forge Dam was badly damaged.  The overflow from the dam divided the borough in half. One family along Main Street was rescued and evacuated. Ross Street was damaged. In Dover Township, forty people were evacuated near the Rockaway River. Nine roadways including New Jersey State Route 15 was flooded. Basements were flooded and cars were stuck in flood waters. In Denville Township, five roads were closed on the 13th near the river. Property right along the river was submerged. A canoeist was rescued from the river after it capsized. The Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 13th. It crested at 5.04 feet at midnight on the 14th and was back within bankfull at 2 a.m. EDT on the 14th. The Rockaway River below the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 7 a.m. EDT on the 13th, crested at 6.59 feet at 1230 p.m. EDT on the 13th and was back within bankfull at 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. The Passaic River at Pine Brook reached its 19 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, crested at 19.24 feet at 1245 p.m. EDT on the 15th and was back within bankfull at Midnight EDT on the 17th. Storm totals on the 12th included 8.46 inches in Berkshire Valley, 6.50 inches in Middle Valley, 5.63 inches in West Wharton, 4.20 inches in Milton, 2.56 inches in Boonton, 1.85 inches in Ironia, 1.82 inches in Chatham, 1.53 inches in Marcella and 1.51 inches in Morris Plains. On Monday the 14th, an additional inch to inch and a half of rain fell across the county. Storm totals included 1.68 inches in Marcella, 1.30 inches in Long Valley and 0.90 inches in Chatham. **** IN WARREN AND HUNTERDON COUNTIES ****Warren and Hunterdon Counties suffered flooding from two sides. There was the initial small stream flooding that occurred with the torrential downpours during the afternoon of the 12th. Then there was the subsequent river flooding along the Musconetcong River after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged on the 13th through the 16th. On the afternoon of the 12th, small stream flooding in Warren County was mainly confined to Allamuchy Township. In Hunterdon County, there was more widespread torrential downpours and flooding affected the eastern half of the county. In Raritan Township, eight apartments were evacuated as access to the homes was cut off by flood waters. Three township roads were closed as the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded. In Readington Township, the Pleasant Run Brook flooded. It flooded and eroded Pleasant Run Road as well as basements along the roadway. A man was rescued in five feet of water on the roadway. A tributary of the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded River Avenue. Stream flooding also caused erosion along Old York Road. In Tewksbury Township, the Rockaway Creek overflowed. In Hampton Borough, the borough park was flooded. After the Furnace Pond Dam (in Sussex County) was damaged on the 13th, flooding began along the Musconetcong River. But, downstream locations received a lucky break when the river flooding changed the course of the river itself. The river diverted itself into the Tilcon Quarry in Mount Olive Township. The quarry became a 75 acre lake and by holding back part of the discharge prevented worse flooding from occurring downstream. Nevertheless, evacuations took place in Warren and Hunterdon Counties, partly because the river was flooding, but also from fear that the Furnace Pond and Musconetcong Lake dams would completely fail. In Hackettstown (Warren County), East Avenue was flooded by the river and families and the elderly were evacuated from Waterloo Road and East Avenue. The East Avenue Bridge into Washington Township (Morris County) was closed due to flooding through Wednesday morning (the 16th). There were several evacuations also in Allamuchy Township (Warren County). About an additional 300 families were recommended to evacuate in the event of dam failure. Families were evacuated near the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County in Bethlehem Township, Bloomsbury Borough, Hampton Borough and Lebanon Township. In Lebanon Township, the Musconetcong flooded Butler's Park and adjacent roadways. Some sheds and barns were flooded. The Musconetcong River crept into some streets and grassy areas as well as throughout the Musconetcong River Greenway. It crested the night of the 14th. The only river related death occurred on the 15th, when a 58-year-old kayaker leapt out of his kayak about twenty yards upstream from the Finesville Road Bridge. Saturday (the 12th) storm totals included 2.87 inches in Stanton (Hunterdon County), 2.60 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County) and 1.51 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County). On Monday the 14th, around an additional 1.50 inches of rain fell, with the highest amounts in southern Hunterdon County. Storm totals included 2.23 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County),  1.42 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County), 1.38 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County) and 0.60 inches in Phillipsburg (Warren County).",NA,PDC

Doppler Radar Storm total estimates reached around 15 inches along the Sussex/Morris County border.  Two to three inches of rain fell per hour in the strongest storms and caused considerable, widespread and devastating flooding across southeastern Sussex County and western Morris County. Mud and rock slides exacerbated the damage. This was approximately a one in a thousand year event. About 2,700 homes and businesses were flooded. Eight houses were totally destroyed, about one hundred suffered major damage.  About 2,600 persons were evacuated in Morris, Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon Counties, including children at a day camp in Byram Township (Sussex County). In Morris County, three bridges were destroyed, two dams were badly damaged, four others suffered some damage and about two dozen roads were closed or damaged. The torrential rain caused a record rise in Lake Hopatcong and lakeside flooding in Jefferson and Roxbury Townships (Morris County). The record level of Lake Hoptacong led to downstream flooding along the Musconetcong River through Warren and Hunterdon Counties. In Sussex County: three dams were destroyed, six other dams were damaged, three bridges were destroyed, eight others were closed or damaged and three roads were swept away.  Countless others were closed. Newton's water mains were ruptured by the flash flooding cutting off its main water supply. A temporary hookup was made to Sparta's water system. It might be up to four years before the lines will be repaired. Water restrictions were placed in effect for those two communities. In addition, residents in Newton, Ogdensburg, Sparta (all Sussex County) and Jefferson and Roxbury (Morris County) were advised to boil their water before consuming it.  The greatest damage to any business occurred to Compac Corporation in Stanhope (Sussex County) after the Furnace Pond Dam failed on Sunday the 13th. The Musconetcong River crashed into the building and flooded the entire first floor. Throughout the area persons were rescued after their vehicles drove into the water on collapsed roadways. Miraculously no serious injuries occurred. Around an inch of additional rain fell on Monday the 14th. This continued the fear of further mudslides, dam collapses and flooding, especially along the Musconetcong River. The additional rain also caused flooding along the main stem of the Passaic River in Morris County. A state of emergency was declared for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 14th. A federal disaster area declaration was issued by President Clinton for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 16th.  Damage was estimated at 179 million dollars. About 12,000 GPU Energy customers lost power. The only death occurred when a 58-year-old man's kayak overturned on the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County on the 15th and he apparently drowned. **** IN SUSSEX COUNTY ****Sussex County bore the brunt of the storm with about 1,700 homes and businesses damaged. About half of the monetary damage occurred to roads, dams, bridges and public buildings. No place was hit harder than Sparta Township. Devastating flooding occurred near and along the Glen Brook and Wallkill River. The raging Glen Brook carved a canyon in Sparta Glen (a township park), uprooted trees and brought boulders down from Edison and Sparta Mountains. The brook also tore the water mains of Newton's water supply from Morris Lake. The two mains were torn for 1.5 miles. Repairs were expected to take up to four years. The lower section of Glen Road (County Route 620) fell into the Sparta Glen. It continued to collapse through Monday (the 14th). A 50 foot by 50 foot and 20 foot deep hole was created where the road was. Repairs were expected to take one year and damage to Sparta Glen was estimated at 2 million dollars. The torrential rains filled ponds and lakes and caused dam failures.  Both the Edison Pond and Seneca Dams were destroyed. In the latter, the 25 acre lake completely drained leaving behind dead fish. The Sparta and Hawthorne Lake Dams were damaged. Three hundred tons of gravel was used to shore the Fox Trail Lake Dam. One hundred homes were evacuated near the dam.  Mudslides down Sparta and Edison Mountains through the 14th covered County Route 517 (Main Street), the tracks of the New York-Susquehanna and Western Railroad and the Eagle's Nest Wastewater pump station. About 200 persons along Main Street were evacuated through Monday (the 14th) out of fear of further mudslides. Slow service along the railroad was restored that afternoon. The road was totally repaired in early October. In addition to Glen Road and the Glen Road Bridge, the flash flooding totally swept away sections of  Edison Road and Old Forge River Road and totally destroyed the Seneca Lake Bridge. Other bridges were damaged including the Main Street, Station Road, Park Street, Morris Lake and the bridge near Arapaho Trail.  Persons living on Old Forge River Road and Morris Lake Road only access to the outside world was via foot bridges. Temporary bridges were reopened by August 26th. The bridge repair near Arapaho Trail was completed on September 25th. Prior to that repair, it took residents and school buses over 45 minutes to reach the downtown areas of Sparta (normally a 10 minute trip). Most of the home damage occurred along Main Street and Glen Road. Three homes in the township were destroyed, seven were deemed uninhabitable and fifty other were damaged.  In Stanhope Borough, the largest singular loss occurred when the Musconetcong River Dam and the Furnace Pond Dam were damaged. The drainage conduit on the Furnace Pond Dam was eroded to three times its normal size when a large concrete chunk broke away. It increased the outflow along the Musconetcong River. The river rose from five feet to twenty feet. The river normally flows underneath the Compac Corporation's building. But the sudden rise ripped away a bank that normally channeled the flow away from the first floor. Instead it flowed straight into the first floor of the building. The water reached six feet high and shifted large amounts of inventory, pushed 2,000 rolls of paper out of the building  and drenched thousands of dollars of equipment. A forty-two inch diameter tree became stuck within the first floor. About 1,800 feet of the parking lot was ripped away. The structural integrity of the building was intact, but all of the company's machinery was damaged. Damage was expected to be in the millions. Production resumed in mid-September. Flood damage also occurred to the nearby Isolatek International Company, but was not as substantial. A few other businesses in Stanhope and Netcong (Morris County) suffered minor damage. The Kelly Place Bridge was damaged and not reopened until September 4th. The New Jersey State Route 183 bridge was also closed because it was flooded, but it was not damaged. In Ogdensburg Borough, three bridges over the Wallkill River were badly damaged (Corkhill Road, Kennedy Avenue and Bridge Street) and closed. About 200 persons were evacuated. These closings either isolated families (they had to walk across makeshift foot bridges) or forced them to go into the next township to reach their homes. Two were still closed in early October. Two roads were closed because the Wallkill River tore away the asphalt. One of them, the Corkhill Road Tunnel was closed indefinitely. Four homes had water damage up to their second floor. A water main on Corkhill Road was breached. This forced the borough to declare a state of  emergency because of  low water supply. It was repaired on Tuesday (the 15th),In Byram Township, the failure of the Seneca Lake Dam led to the destruction of the Tomahawk Lake Dam and the Tomahawk Trail Bridge (near the Sparta border). The Tomahawk Water Recreation Park was destroyed.  The Lake Drive Bridge near Lake Lackawanna was closed indefinitely. The Kelly Place Bridge was also damaged. Three hundred families in the Brookwood Neighborhood along River Road near the Musconetcong River were evacuated on Monday (the 14th). Hundreds of children were evacuated on Monday from the Jefferson Lake Day Camp because of the unknown integrity of a nearby dam.  In Hardyston Township, About 20 families were evacuated from around Summit Lake. The dams around Summit Lake, Tamarack Lake and Lake Girard were damaged, but remained intact. The Tamarack Lake Dam was aided by 1,000 sandbags. New Jersey State Route 23 was closed in Stockholm. The township estimated property damage at nearly one million dollars.  In Newton Town, a strip mall was submerged. But the largest problem was the loss of its two water mains from Morris Lake. It supplied 80 percent of the town's water. Half of the town lost its water instantaneously. The town set up four 5,000 gallon water tankers to distribute water. Many businesses were closed on Monday the 14th. A temporary connection to Sparta's water supply was completed on Tuesday the 15th. But it was estimated that it will take from 1 to 4 years to re-establish its own water supply at a cost of up to 3 million dollars. In Franklin Borough, about 130 persons were evacuated along the Wallkill River and Franklin Pond. County Route 517 into Sparta Township was closed because of mudslides. Elsewhere in Sussex County, a few roads were closed due to flooding in Frankford Township, Hamburg Borough, Lafayette Township and Wantage Township. About a dozen businesses suffered flood damage in Franklin and Hamburg Boroughs and  Sparta Township. Farms were flooded along the Wallkill River. Saturday's storm totals included 14.11 inches in Sparta, 6.84 inches in Hamburg, 4.33 inches in Stockholm, 2.84 inches in Vernon, 2.47 inches in Wantage, 2.08 inches in Sussex and 1.18 inches in Andover. On Monday the 14th, 1.15 inches fell in Andover and 0.71 inches in Andover.**** IN MORRIS COUNTY ****In Morris County, the unprecedented rainfall caused a record rise on Lake Hoptacong as well as flash flooding across the western part of the county. Flooding along the Rockaway River then pushed downstream toward and beyond the Boonton Reservoir. Flooding also occurred around Lake Shawnee and was exacerbated by damage to its dam. About 1,000 homes and businesses were damaged. Two houses were destroyed, 75 suffered major damage while 727 others suffered minor damage. About two dozen county bridges and roads were damaged. Three bridges were destroyed. Hundreds of roads were closed including the much traveled New Jersey State Route 15. Vehicles drove into flood waters after several roadways collapsed. About 150 persons were rescued from flood waters. About 400 persons were evacuated, mainly from locations near Lake Hopatcong and Lake Shawnee. Damage in the county was estimated at 12 million dollars.The hardest hit municipality in Morris County was Jefferson Township. The heaviest rain in the county fell over this township with Doppler Radar storm total estimates of 15 inches. The township suffered flooding from three fronts: Lake Hopatcong, Lake Shawnee and the Rockaway River and its tributaries. Lake Hopatcong rose nearly twelve feet on Saturday (the 12th) to its highest level in 114 years of record. At 6 a.m. EDT on Sunday (the 13th), the lake was 34 inches above the dam that spills into the Musconetcong River (in Roxbury Township). The previous record was set in 1955. The rise in Lake Hopatcong flooded the basements of lakeside homes. Fish were found in the basements. The lake also lifted boats above fixed docks and eventually pulled them under water. Hundreds of docks and dozens of boats were pulled under water. Other boats sunk. Boat lines were cut in the hopes of stopping boats from sinking. Sections of docks, propane tanks and lawn furniture were floating in the lake. The State Police Marine Bureau  in Great Cove was flooded. After the rain ended, a boating ban was placed in effect to prevent damage to boats by the debris and further lakefront home damage from waves. A swimming ban was also in effect due to goose droppings that streamed into the lake, oil escaping from sunken boats and outflow from nearby septic tanks. A boil drinking water advisory was issued by both Jefferson and Roxbury Townships. The Lake Shawnee Dam was badly damaged. The lake engulfed homes, damaged boats and tore off driveways. Residents were evacuated from around the lake. The loosened ground helped a tree crash onto a house near the lake. The torrential rain caused flash flooding along the Rockaway River and its tributaries. The Dover-Milton Road Bridge and two bridges on Taylor Road between County Route 699 and New Jersey State Route 15 were destroyed. They were reopened by the 28th of August. Bridges on Lower Berkshire Valley Road, Russia Road and Lorettacong Trail were closed due to roadway washouts. Vehicles drove into flood waters. Boulders, tree stumps and tires littered roadways. New Jersey State Route 15 was closed in several locations because of either flooding or rock slides. The worst one occurred toward Interstate 80. The state route was reopened on the 13th by using the shoulder on the south side of the highway. Flooding was so high on Espanong Road that a dog was rescued from a roof. Roads along Weldon Brook were also flooded. Several township dams (Lake Winona, Swannanoa, Hartung and No Name #51) showed signs of erosion and wear, but held. In Roxbury Township, all 160 lakeside (Hopatcong) homes had water encroaching upon the docks. Forty-eight homes had either interior flood or structural damage. Two businesses along the lake were badly damaged. Berkshire Valley Road was closed. In Mount Arlington Borough, flooding near the lake started at 10 a.m. EDT. About 50 homes were evacuated along the lake.  In Mount Olive Township, the worst flooding occurred on Sunday the 13th and Monday the 14th after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged. The rising Musconetcong River changed its course and flooded the Tilcon Quarry. The quarry became a 75 acre lake. Two bridges were closed between the township and Netcong Borough. As a precaution, New Jersey Transit canceled service between Mount Olive Township and Hackettstown on the 14th. The fortunate diversion of the river into the active quarry prevented flood damage from occurring farther downstream in Warren and Hunterdon Counties. It is expected to take several months to dry the Tilcon Quarry. About five homes along the river were evacuated on the 14th. A couple of businesses along the river in Netcong Borough were flooded. In Washington Township, the East Avenue Bridge (over the Musconetcong River) into Hackettstown was closed through the morning of the 15th. Elsewhere, in Rockaway Township, New Jersey State Route 15 was also closed near Mase Mountain as trees, boulders and dirt washed across the roadway. Several families were evacuated after flood waters ripped away a 30 foot chunk of the foundation under Mountain View Manor. There were wet basements throughout the township. Even though the rain was lighter, flooding along the Rockaway River extended downstream from Jefferson Township. In Wharton Borough, the Washington Forge Dam was badly damaged.  The overflow from the dam divided the borough in half. One family along Main Street was rescued and evacuated. Ross Street was damaged. In Dover Township, forty people were evacuated near the Rockaway River. Nine roadways including New Jersey State Route 15 was flooded. Basements were flooded and cars were stuck in flood waters. In Denville Township, five roads were closed on the 13th near the river. Property right along the river was submerged. A canoeist was rescued from the river after it capsized. The Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 13th. It crested at 5.04 feet at midnight on the 14th and was back within bankfull at 2 a.m. EDT on the 14th. The Rockaway River below the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 7 a.m. EDT on the 13th, crested at 6.59 feet at 1230 p.m. EDT on the 13th and was back within bankfull at 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. The Passaic River at Pine Brook reached its 19 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, crested at 19.24 feet at 1245 p.m. EDT on the 15th and was back within bankfull at Midnight EDT on the 17th. Storm totals on the 12th included 8.46 inches in Berkshire Valley, 6.50 inches in Middle Valley, 5.63 inches in West Wharton, 4.20 inches in Milton, 2.56 inches in Boonton, 1.85 inches in Ironia, 1.82 inches in Chatham, 1.53 inches in Marcella and 1.51 inches in Morris Plains. On Monday the 14th, an additional inch to inch and a half of rain fell across the county. Storm totals included 1.68 inches in Marcella, 1.30 inches in Long Valley and 0.90 inches in Chatham. **** IN WARREN AND HUNTERDON COUNTIES ****Warren and Hunterdon Counties suffered flooding from two sides. There was the initial small stream flooding that occurred with the torrential downpours during the afternoon of the 12th. Then there was the subsequent river flooding along the Musconetcong River after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged on the 13th through the 16th. On the afternoon of the 12th, small stream flooding in Warren County was mainly confined to Allamuchy Township. In Hunterdon County, there was more widespread torrential downpours and flooding affected the eastern half of the county. In Raritan Township, eight apartments were evacuated as access to the homes was cut off by flood waters. Three township roads were closed as the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded. In Readington Township, the Pleasant Run Brook flooded. It flooded and eroded Pleasant Run Road as well as basements along the roadway. A man was rescued in five feet of water on the roadway. A tributary of the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded River Avenue. Stream flooding also caused erosion along Old York Road. In Tewksbury Township, the Rockaway Creek overflowed. In Hampton Borough, the borough park was flooded. After the Furnace Pond Dam (in Sussex County) was damaged on the 13th, flooding began along the Musconetcong River. But, downstream locations received a lucky break when the river flooding changed the course of the river itself. The river diverted itself into the Tilcon Quarry in Mount Olive Township. The quarry became a 75 acre lake and by holding back part of the discharge prevented worse flooding from occurring downstream. Nevertheless, evacuations took place in Warren and Hunterdon Counties, partly because the river was flooding, but also from fear that the Furnace Pond and Musconetcong Lake dams would completely fail. In Hackettstown (Warren County), East Avenue was flooded by the river and families and the elderly were evacuated from Waterloo Road and East Avenue. The East Avenue Bridge into Washington Township (Morris County) was closed due to flooding through Wednesday morning (the 16th). There were several evacuations also in Allamuchy Township (Warren County). About an additional 300 families were recommended to evacuate in the event of dam failure. Families were evacuated near the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County in Bethlehem Township, Bloomsbury Borough, Hampton Borough and Lebanon Township. In Lebanon Township, the Musconetcong flooded Butler's Park and adjacent roadways. Some sheds and barns were flooded. The Musconetcong River crept into some streets and grassy areas as well as throughout the Musconetcong River Greenway. It crested the night of the 14th. The only river related death occurred on the 15th, when a 58-year-old kayaker leapt out of his kayak about twenty yards upstream from the Finesville Road Bridge. Saturday (the 12th) storm totals included 2.87 inches in Stanton (Hunterdon County), 2.60 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County) and 1.51 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County). On Monday the 14th, around an additional 1.50 inches of rain fell, with the highest amounts in southern Hunterdon County. Storm totals included 2.23 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County),  1.42 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County), 1.38 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County) and 0.60 inches in Phillipsburg (Warren County).",NA,PDC

Doppler Radar Storm total estimates reached around 15 inches along the Sussex/Morris County border.  Two to three inches of rain fell per hour in the strongest storms and caused considerable, widespread and devastating flooding across southeastern Sussex County and western Morris County. Mud and rock slides exacerbated the damage. This was approximately a one in a thousand year event. About 2,700 homes and businesses were flooded. Eight houses were totally destroyed, about one hundred suffered major damage.  About 2,600 persons were evacuated in Morris, Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon Counties, including children at a day camp in Byram Township (Sussex County). In Morris County, three bridges were destroyed, two dams were badly damaged, four others suffered some damage and about two dozen roads were closed or damaged. The torrential rain caused a record rise in Lake Hopatcong and lakeside flooding in Jefferson and Roxbury Townships (Morris County). The record level of Lake Hoptacong led to downstream flooding along the Musconetcong River through Warren and Hunterdon Counties. In Sussex County: three dams were destroyed, six other dams were damaged, three bridges were destroyed, eight others were closed or damaged and three roads were swept away.  Countless others were closed. Newton's water mains were ruptured by the flash flooding cutting off its main water supply. A temporary hookup was made to Sparta's water system. It might be up to four years before the lines will be repaired. Water restrictions were placed in effect for those two communities. In addition, residents in Newton, Ogdensburg, Sparta (all Sussex County) and Jefferson and Roxbury (Morris County) were advised to boil their water before consuming it.  The greatest damage to any business occurred to Compac Corporation in Stanhope (Sussex County) after the Furnace Pond Dam failed on Sunday the 13th. The Musconetcong River crashed into the building and flooded the entire first floor. Throughout the area persons were rescued after their vehicles drove into the water on collapsed roadways. Miraculously no serious injuries occurred. Around an inch of additional rain fell on Monday the 14th. This continued the fear of further mudslides, dam collapses and flooding, especially along the Musconetcong River. The additional rain also caused flooding along the main stem of the Passaic River in Morris County. A state of emergency was declared for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 14th. A federal disaster area declaration was issued by President Clinton for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 16th.  Damage was estimated at 179 million dollars. About 12,000 GPU Energy customers lost power. The only death occurred when a 58-year-old man's kayak overturned on the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County on the 15th and he apparently drowned. **** IN SUSSEX COUNTY ****Sussex County bore the brunt of the storm with about 1,700 homes and businesses damaged. About half of the monetary damage occurred to roads, dams, bridges and public buildings. No place was hit harder than Sparta Township. Devastating flooding occurred near and along the Glen Brook and Wallkill River. The raging Glen Brook carved a canyon in Sparta Glen (a township park), uprooted trees and brought boulders down from Edison and Sparta Mountains. The brook also tore the water mains of Newton's water supply from Morris Lake. The two mains were torn for 1.5 miles. Repairs were expected to take up to four years. The lower section of Glen Road (County Route 620) fell into the Sparta Glen. It continued to collapse through Monday (the 14th). A 50 foot by 50 foot and 20 foot deep hole was created where the road was. Repairs were expected to take one year and damage to Sparta Glen was estimated at 2 million dollars. The torrential rains filled ponds and lakes and caused dam failures.  Both the Edison Pond and Seneca Dams were destroyed. In the latter, the 25 acre lake completely drained leaving behind dead fish. The Sparta and Hawthorne Lake Dams were damaged. Three hundred tons of gravel was used to shore the Fox Trail Lake Dam. One hundred homes were evacuated near the dam.  Mudslides down Sparta and Edison Mountains through the 14th covered County Route 517 (Main Street), the tracks of the New York-Susquehanna and Western Railroad and the Eagle's Nest Wastewater pump station. About 200 persons along Main Street were evacuated through Monday (the 14th) out of fear of further mudslides. Slow service along the railroad was restored that afternoon. The road was totally repaired in early October. In addition to Glen Road and the Glen Road Bridge, the flash flooding totally swept away sections of  Edison Road and Old Forge River Road and totally destroyed the Seneca Lake Bridge. Other bridges were damaged including the Main Street, Station Road, Park Street, Morris Lake and the bridge near Arapaho Trail.  Persons living on Old Forge River Road and Morris Lake Road only access to the outside world was via foot bridges. Temporary bridges were reopened by August 26th. The bridge repair near Arapaho Trail was completed on September 25th. Prior to that repair, it took residents and school buses over 45 minutes to reach the downtown areas of Sparta (normally a 10 minute trip). Most of the home damage occurred along Main Street and Glen Road. Three homes in the township were destroyed, seven were deemed uninhabitable and fifty other were damaged.  In Stanhope Borough, the largest singular loss occurred when the Musconetcong River Dam and the Furnace Pond Dam were damaged. The drainage conduit on the Furnace Pond Dam was eroded to three times its normal size when a large concrete chunk broke away. It increased the outflow along the Musconetcong River. The river rose from five feet to twenty feet. The river normally flows underneath the Compac Corporation's building. But the sudden rise ripped away a bank that normally channeled the flow away from the first floor. Instead it flowed straight into the first floor of the building. The water reached six feet high and shifted large amounts of inventory, pushed 2,000 rolls of paper out of the building  and drenched thousands of dollars of equipment. A forty-two inch diameter tree became stuck within the first floor. About 1,800 feet of the parking lot was ripped away. The structural integrity of the building was intact, but all of the company's machinery was damaged. Damage was expected to be in the millions. Production resumed in mid-September. Flood damage also occurred to the nearby Isolatek International Company, but was not as substantial. A few other businesses in Stanhope and Netcong (Morris County) suffered minor damage. The Kelly Place Bridge was damaged and not reopened until September 4th. The New Jersey State Route 183 bridge was also closed because it was flooded, but it was not damaged. In Ogdensburg Borough, three bridges over the Wallkill River were badly damaged (Corkhill Road, Kennedy Avenue and Bridge Street) and closed. About 200 persons were evacuated. These closings either isolated families (they had to walk across makeshift foot bridges) or forced them to go into the next township to reach their homes. Two were still closed in early October. Two roads were closed because the Wallkill River tore away the asphalt. One of them, the Corkhill Road Tunnel was closed indefinitely. Four homes had water damage up to their second floor. A water main on Corkhill Road was breached. This forced the borough to declare a state of  emergency because of  low water supply. It was repaired on Tuesday (the 15th),In Byram Township, the failure of the Seneca Lake Dam led to the destruction of the Tomahawk Lake Dam and the Tomahawk Trail Bridge (near the Sparta border). The Tomahawk Water Recreation Park was destroyed.  The Lake Drive Bridge near Lake Lackawanna was closed indefinitely. The Kelly Place Bridge was also damaged. Three hundred families in the Brookwood Neighborhood along River Road near the Musconetcong River were evacuated on Monday (the 14th). Hundreds of children were evacuated on Monday from the Jefferson Lake Day Camp because of the unknown integrity of a nearby dam.  In Hardyston Township, About 20 families were evacuated from around Summit Lake. The dams around Summit Lake, Tamarack Lake and Lake Girard were damaged, but remained intact. The Tamarack Lake Dam was aided by 1,000 sandbags. New Jersey State Route 23 was closed in Stockholm. The township estimated property damage at nearly one million dollars.  In Newton Town, a strip mall was submerged. But the largest problem was the loss of its two water mains from Morris Lake. It supplied 80 percent of the town's water. Half of the town lost its water instantaneously. The town set up four 5,000 gallon water tankers to distribute water. Many businesses were closed on Monday the 14th. A temporary connection to Sparta's water supply was completed on Tuesday the 15th. But it was estimated that it will take from 1 to 4 years to re-establish its own water supply at a cost of up to 3 million dollars. In Franklin Borough, about 130 persons were evacuated along the Wallkill River and Franklin Pond. County Route 517 into Sparta Township was closed because of mudslides. Elsewhere in Sussex County, a few roads were closed due to flooding in Frankford Township, Hamburg Borough, Lafayette Township and Wantage Township. About a dozen businesses suffered flood damage in Franklin and Hamburg Boroughs and  Sparta Township. Farms were flooded along the Wallkill River. Saturday's storm totals included 14.11 inches in Sparta, 6.84 inches in Hamburg, 4.33 inches in Stockholm, 2.84 inches in Vernon, 2.47 inches in Wantage, 2.08 inches in Sussex and 1.18 inches in Andover. On Monday the 14th, 1.15 inches fell in Andover and 0.71 inches in Andover.**** IN MORRIS COUNTY ****In Morris County, the unprecedented rainfall caused a record rise on Lake Hoptacong as well as flash flooding across the western part of the county. Flooding along the Rockaway River then pushed downstream toward and beyond the Boonton Reservoir. Flooding also occurred around Lake Shawnee and was exacerbated by damage to its dam. About 1,000 homes and businesses were damaged. Two houses were destroyed, 75 suffered major damage while 727 others suffered minor damage. About two dozen county bridges and roads were damaged. Three bridges were destroyed. Hundreds of roads were closed including the much traveled New Jersey State Route 15. Vehicles drove into flood waters after several roadways collapsed. About 150 persons were rescued from flood waters. About 400 persons were evacuated, mainly from locations near Lake Hopatcong and Lake Shawnee. Damage in the county was estimated at 12 million dollars.The hardest hit municipality in Morris County was Jefferson Township. The heaviest rain in the county fell over this township with Doppler Radar storm total estimates of 15 inches. The township suffered flooding from three fronts: Lake Hopatcong, Lake Shawnee and the Rockaway River and its tributaries. Lake Hopatcong rose nearly twelve feet on Saturday (the 12th) to its highest level in 114 years of record. At 6 a.m. EDT on Sunday (the 13th), the lake was 34 inches above the dam that spills into the Musconetcong River (in Roxbury Township). The previous record was set in 1955. The rise in Lake Hopatcong flooded the basements of lakeside homes. Fish were found in the basements. The lake also lifted boats above fixed docks and eventually pulled them under water. Hundreds of docks and dozens of boats were pulled under water. Other boats sunk. Boat lines were cut in the hopes of stopping boats from sinking. Sections of docks, propane tanks and lawn furniture were floating in the lake. The State Police Marine Bureau  in Great Cove was flooded. After the rain ended, a boating ban was placed in effect to prevent damage to boats by the debris and further lakefront home damage from waves. A swimming ban was also in effect due to goose droppings that streamed into the lake, oil escaping from sunken boats and outflow from nearby septic tanks. A boil drinking water advisory was issued by both Jefferson and Roxbury Townships. The Lake Shawnee Dam was badly damaged. The lake engulfed homes, damaged boats and tore off driveways. Residents were evacuated from around the lake. The loosened ground helped a tree crash onto a house near the lake. The torrential rain caused flash flooding along the Rockaway River and its tributaries. The Dover-Milton Road Bridge and two bridges on Taylor Road between County Route 699 and New Jersey State Route 15 were destroyed. They were reopened by the 28th of August. Bridges on Lower Berkshire Valley Road, Russia Road and Lorettacong Trail were closed due to roadway washouts. Vehicles drove into flood waters. Boulders, tree stumps and tires littered roadways. New Jersey State Route 15 was closed in several locations because of either flooding or rock slides. The worst one occurred toward Interstate 80. The state route was reopened on the 13th by using the shoulder on the south side of the highway. Flooding was so high on Espanong Road that a dog was rescued from a roof. Roads along Weldon Brook were also flooded. Several township dams (Lake Winona, Swannanoa, Hartung and No Name #51) showed signs of erosion and wear, but held. In Roxbury Township, all 160 lakeside (Hopatcong) homes had water encroaching upon the docks. Forty-eight homes had either interior flood or structural damage. Two businesses along the lake were badly damaged. Berkshire Valley Road was closed. In Mount Arlington Borough, flooding near the lake started at 10 a.m. EDT. About 50 homes were evacuated along the lake.  In Mount Olive Township, the worst flooding occurred on Sunday the 13th and Monday the 14th after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged. The rising Musconetcong River changed its course and flooded the Tilcon Quarry. The quarry became a 75 acre lake. Two bridges were closed between the township and Netcong Borough. As a precaution, New Jersey Transit canceled service between Mount Olive Township and Hackettstown on the 14th. The fortunate diversion of the river into the active quarry prevented flood damage from occurring farther downstream in Warren and Hunterdon Counties. It is expected to take several months to dry the Tilcon Quarry. About five homes along the river were evacuated on the 14th. A couple of businesses along the river in Netcong Borough were flooded. In Washington Township, the East Avenue Bridge (over the Musconetcong River) into Hackettstown was closed through the morning of the 15th. Elsewhere, in Rockaway Township, New Jersey State Route 15 was also closed near Mase Mountain as trees, boulders and dirt washed across the roadway. Several families were evacuated after flood waters ripped away a 30 foot chunk of the foundation under Mountain View Manor. There were wet basements throughout the township. Even though the rain was lighter, flooding along the Rockaway River extended downstream from Jefferson Township. In Wharton Borough, the Washington Forge Dam was badly damaged.  The overflow from the dam divided the borough in half. One family along Main Street was rescued and evacuated. Ross Street was damaged. In Dover Township, forty people were evacuated near the Rockaway River. Nine roadways including New Jersey State Route 15 was flooded. Basements were flooded and cars were stuck in flood waters. In Denville Township, five roads were closed on the 13th near the river. Property right along the river was submerged. A canoeist was rescued from the river after it capsized. The Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 13th. It crested at 5.04 feet at midnight on the 14th and was back within bankfull at 2 a.m. EDT on the 14th. The Rockaway River below the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 7 a.m. EDT on the 13th, crested at 6.59 feet at 1230 p.m. EDT on the 13th and was back within bankfull at 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. The Passaic River at Pine Brook reached its 19 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, crested at 19.24 feet at 1245 p.m. EDT on the 15th and was back within bankfull at Midnight EDT on the 17th. Storm totals on the 12th included 8.46 inches in Berkshire Valley, 6.50 inches in Middle Valley, 5.63 inches in West Wharton, 4.20 inches in Milton, 2.56 inches in Boonton, 1.85 inches in Ironia, 1.82 inches in Chatham, 1.53 inches in Marcella and 1.51 inches in Morris Plains. On Monday the 14th, an additional inch to inch and a half of rain fell across the county. Storm totals included 1.68 inches in Marcella, 1.30 inches in Long Valley and 0.90 inches in Chatham. **** IN WARREN AND HUNTERDON COUNTIES ****Warren and Hunterdon Counties suffered flooding from two sides. There was the initial small stream flooding that occurred with the torrential downpours during the afternoon of the 12th. Then there was the subsequent river flooding along the Musconetcong River after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged on the 13th through the 16th. On the afternoon of the 12th, small stream flooding in Warren County was mainly confined to Allamuchy Township. In Hunterdon County, there was more widespread torrential downpours and flooding affected the eastern half of the county. In Raritan Township, eight apartments were evacuated as access to the homes was cut off by flood waters. Three township roads were closed as the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded. In Readington Township, the Pleasant Run Brook flooded. It flooded and eroded Pleasant Run Road as well as basements along the roadway. A man was rescued in five feet of water on the roadway. A tributary of the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded River Avenue. Stream flooding also caused erosion along Old York Road. In Tewksbury Township, the Rockaway Creek overflowed. In Hampton Borough, the borough park was flooded. After the Furnace Pond Dam (in Sussex County) was damaged on the 13th, flooding began along the Musconetcong River. But, downstream locations received a lucky break when the river flooding changed the course of the river itself. The river diverted itself into the Tilcon Quarry in Mount Olive Township. The quarry became a 75 acre lake and by holding back part of the discharge prevented worse flooding from occurring downstream. Nevertheless, evacuations took place in Warren and Hunterdon Counties, partly because the river was flooding, but also from fear that the Furnace Pond and Musconetcong Lake dams would completely fail. In Hackettstown (Warren County), East Avenue was flooded by the river and families and the elderly were evacuated from Waterloo Road and East Avenue. The East Avenue Bridge into Washington Township (Morris County) was closed due to flooding through Wednesday morning (the 16th). There were several evacuations also in Allamuchy Township (Warren County). About an additional 300 families were recommended to evacuate in the event of dam failure. Families were evacuated near the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County in Bethlehem Township, Bloomsbury Borough, Hampton Borough and Lebanon Township. In Lebanon Township, the Musconetcong flooded Butler's Park and adjacent roadways. Some sheds and barns were flooded. The Musconetcong River crept into some streets and grassy areas as well as throughout the Musconetcong River Greenway. It crested the night of the 14th. The only river related death occurred on the 15th, when a 58-year-old kayaker leapt out of his kayak about twenty yards upstream from the Finesville Road Bridge. Saturday (the 12th) storm totals included 2.87 inches in Stanton (Hunterdon County), 2.60 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County) and 1.51 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County). On Monday the 14th, around an additional 1.50 inches of rain fell, with the highest amounts in southern Hunterdon County. Storm totals included 2.23 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County),  1.42 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County), 1.38 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County) and 0.60 inches in Phillipsburg (Warren County).",NA,PDC

Doppler Radar Storm total estimates reached around 15 inches along the Sussex/Morris County border.  Two to three inches of rain fell per hour in the strongest storms and caused considerable, widespread and devastating flooding across southeastern Sussex County and western Morris County. Mud and rock slides exacerbated the damage. This was approximately a one in a thousand year event. About 2,700 homes and businesses were flooded. Eight houses were totally destroyed, about one hundred suffered major damage.  About 2,600 persons were evacuated in Morris, Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon Counties, including children at a day camp in Byram Township (Sussex County). In Morris County, three bridges were destroyed, two dams were badly damaged, four others suffered some damage and about two dozen roads were closed or damaged. The torrential rain caused a record rise in Lake Hopatcong and lakeside flooding in Jefferson and Roxbury Townships (Morris County). The record level of Lake Hoptacong led to downstream flooding along the Musconetcong River through Warren and Hunterdon Counties. In Sussex County: three dams were destroyed, six other dams were damaged, three bridges were destroyed, eight others were closed or damaged and three roads were swept away.  Countless others were closed. Newton's water mains were ruptured by the flash flooding cutting off its main water supply. A temporary hookup was made to Sparta's water system. It might be up to four years before the lines will be repaired. Water restrictions were placed in effect for those two communities. In addition, residents in Newton, Ogdensburg, Sparta (all Sussex County) and Jefferson and Roxbury (Morris County) were advised to boil their water before consuming it.  The greatest damage to any business occurred to Compac Corporation in Stanhope (Sussex County) after the Furnace Pond Dam failed on Sunday the 13th. The Musconetcong River crashed into the building and flooded the entire first floor. Throughout the area persons were rescued after their vehicles drove into the water on collapsed roadways. Miraculously no serious injuries occurred. Around an inch of additional rain fell on Monday the 14th. This continued the fear of further mudslides, dam collapses and flooding, especially along the Musconetcong River. The additional rain also caused flooding along the main stem of the Passaic River in Morris County. A state of emergency was declared for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 14th. A federal disaster area declaration was issued by President Clinton for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 16th.  Damage was estimated at 179 million dollars. About 12,000 GPU Energy customers lost power. The only death occurred when a 58-year-old man's kayak overturned on the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County on the 15th and he apparently drowned. **** IN SUSSEX COUNTY ****Sussex County bore the brunt of the storm with about 1,700 homes and businesses damaged. About half of the monetary damage occurred to roads, dams, bridges and public buildings. No place was hit harder than Sparta Township. Devastating flooding occurred near and along the Glen Brook and Wallkill River. The raging Glen Brook carved a canyon in Sparta Glen (a township park), uprooted trees and brought boulders down from Edison and Sparta Mountains. The brook also tore the water mains of Newton's water supply from Morris Lake. The two mains were torn for 1.5 miles. Repairs were expected to take up to four years. The lower section of Glen Road (County Route 620) fell into the Sparta Glen. It continued to collapse through Monday (the 14th). A 50 foot by 50 foot and 20 foot deep hole was created where the road was. Repairs were expected to take one year and damage to Sparta Glen was estimated at 2 million dollars. The torrential rains filled ponds and lakes and caused dam failures.  Both the Edison Pond and Seneca Dams were destroyed. In the latter, the 25 acre lake completely drained leaving behind dead fish. The Sparta and Hawthorne Lake Dams were damaged. Three hundred tons of gravel was used to shore the Fox Trail Lake Dam. One hundred homes were evacuated near the dam.  Mudslides down Sparta and Edison Mountains through the 14th covered County Route 517 (Main Street), the tracks of the New York-Susquehanna and Western Railroad and the Eagle's Nest Wastewater pump station. About 200 persons along Main Street were evacuated through Monday (the 14th) out of fear of further mudslides. Slow service along the railroad was restored that afternoon. The road was totally repaired in early October. In addition to Glen Road and the Glen Road Bridge, the flash flooding totally swept away sections of  Edison Road and Old Forge River Road and totally destroyed the Seneca Lake Bridge. Other bridges were damaged including the Main Street, Station Road, Park Street, Morris Lake and the bridge near Arapaho Trail.  Persons living on Old Forge River Road and Morris Lake Road only access to the outside world was via foot bridges. Temporary bridges were reopened by August 26th. The bridge repair near Arapaho Trail was completed on September 25th. Prior to that repair, it took residents and school buses over 45 minutes to reach the downtown areas of Sparta (normally a 10 minute trip). Most of the home damage occurred along Main Street and Glen Road. Three homes in the township were destroyed, seven were deemed uninhabitable and fifty other were damaged.  In Stanhope Borough, the largest singular loss occurred when the Musconetcong River Dam and the Furnace Pond Dam were damaged. The drainage conduit on the Furnace Pond Dam was eroded to three times its normal size when a large concrete chunk broke away. It increased the outflow along the Musconetcong River.

Flood damage also occurred to the nearby Isolatek International Company, but was not as substantial. A few other businesses in Stanhope and Netcong (Morris County) suffered minor damage. The Kelly Place Bridge was damaged and not reopened until September 4th. The New Jersey State Route 183 bridge was also closed because it was flooded, but it was not damaged. In Ogdensburg Borough, three bridges over the Wallkill River were badly damaged (Corkhill Road, Kennedy Avenue and Bridge Street) and closed. About 200 persons were evacuated. These closings either isolated families (they had to walk across makeshift foot bridges) or forced them to go into the next township to reach their homes. Two were still closed in early October. Two roads were closed because the Wallkill River tore away the asphalt. One of them, the Corkhill Road Tunnel was closed indefinitely. Four homes had water damage up to their second floor. A water main on Corkhill Road was breached. This forced the borough to declare a state of  emergency because of  low water supply.

The Tomahawk Water Recreation Park was destroyed.  The Lake Drive Bridge near Lake Lackawanna was closed indefinitely. The Kelly Place Bridge was also damaged. Three hundred families in the Brookwood Neighborhood along River Road near the Musconetcong River were evacuated on Monday (the 14th). Hundreds of children were evacuated on Monday from the Jefferson Lake Day Camp because of the unknown integrity of a nearby dam.  In Hardyston Township, About 20 families were evacuated from around Summit Lake. The dams around Summit Lake, Tamarack Lake and Lake Girard were damaged, but remained intact. The Tamarack Lake Dam was aided by 1,000 sandbags. New Jersey State Route 23 was closed in Stockholm. The township estimated property damage at nearly one million dollars.  In Newton Town, a strip mall was submerged. But the largest problem was the loss of its two water mains from Morris Lake. It supplied 80 percent of the town's water. Half of the town lost its water instantaneously. The town set up four 5,000 gallon water tankers to distribute water. Many businesses were closed on Monday the 14th. A temporary connection to Sparta's water supply was completed on Tuesday the 15th. But it was estimated that it will take from 1 to 4 years to re-establish its own water supply at a cost of up to 3 million dollars. In Franklin Borough, about 130 persons were evacuated along the Wallkill River and Franklin Pond. County Route 517 into Sparta Township was closed because of mudslides. Elsewhere in Sussex County, a few roads were closed due to flooding in Frankford Township, Hamburg Borough, Lafayette Township and Wantage Township. About a dozen businesses suffered flood damage in Franklin and Hamburg Boroughs and  Sparta Township. Farms were flooded along the Wallkill River. Saturday's storm totals included 14.11 inches in Sparta, 6.84 inches in Hamburg, 4.33 inches in Stockholm, 2.84 inches in Vernon, 2.47 inches in Wantage, 2.08 inches in Sussex and 1.18 inches in Andover. On Monday the 14th, 1.15 inches fell in Andover and 0.71 inches in Andover.**** IN MORRIS COUNTY ****In Morris County, the unprecedented rainfall caused a record rise on Lake Hoptacong as well as flash flooding across the western part of the county. Flooding along the Rockaway River then pushed downstream toward and beyond the Boonton Reservoir. Flooding also occurred around Lake Shawnee and was exacerbated by damage to its dam. About 1,000 homes and businesses were damaged. Two houses were destroyed, 75 suffered major damage while 727 others suffered minor damage. About two dozen county bridges and roads were damaged. Three bridges were destroyed. Hundreds of roads were closed including the much traveled New Jersey State Route 15. Vehicles drove into flood waters after several roadways collapsed.

Residents were evacuated from around the lake. The loosened ground helped a tree crash onto a house near the lake. The torrential rain caused flash flooding along the Rockaway River and its tributaries. The Dover-Milton Road Bridge and two bridges on Taylor Road between County Route 699 and New Jersey State Route 15 were destroyed. They were reopened by the 28th of August. Bridges on Lower Berkshire Valley Road, Russia Road and Lorettacong Trail were closed due to roadway washouts. Vehicles drove into flood waters. Boulders, tree stumps and tires littered roadways. New Jersey State Route 15 was closed in several locations because of either flooding or rock slides. The worst one occurred toward Interstate 80. The state route was reopened on the 13th by using the shoulder on the south side of the highway. Flooding was so high on Espanong Road that a dog was rescued from a roof. Roads along Weldon Brook were also flooded. Several township dams (Lake Winona, Swannanoa, Hartung and No Name #51) showed signs of erosion and wear, but held. In Roxbury Township, all 160 lakeside (Hopatcong) homes had water encroaching upon the docks. Forty-eight homes had either interior flood or structural damage. Two businesses along the lake were badly damaged. Berkshire Valley Road was closed. In Mount Arlington Borough, flooding near the lake started at 10 a.m. EDT. About 50 homes were evacuated along the lake.  In Mount Olive Township, the worst flooding occurred on Sunday the 13th and Monday the 14th after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged. The rising Musconetcong River changed its course and flooded the Tilcon Quarry. The quarry became a 75 acre lake. Two bridges were closed between the township and Netcong Borough. As a precaution, New Jersey Transit canceled service between Mount Olive Township and Hackettstown on the 14th. The fortunate diversion of the river into the active quarry prevented flood damage from occurring farther downstream in Warren and Hunterdon Counties. It is expected to take several months to dry the Tilcon Quarry. About five homes along the river were evacuated on the 14th. A couple of businesses along the river in Netcong Borough were flooded. In Washington Township, the East Avenue Bridge (over the Musconetcong River) into Hackettstown was closed through the morning of the 15th. Elsewhere, in Rockaway Township, New Jersey State Route 15 was also closed near Mase Mountain as trees, boulders and dirt washed across the roadway. Several families were evacuated after flood waters ripped away a 30 foot chunk of the foundation under Mountain View Manor. There were wet basements throughout the township.

There was the initial small stream flooding that occurred with the torrential downpours during the afternoon of the 12th. Then there was the subsequent river flooding along the Musconetcong River after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged on the 13th through the 16th. On the afternoon of the 12th, small stream flooding in Warren County was mainly confined to Allamuchy Township. In Hunterdon County, there was more widespread torrential downpours and flooding affected the eastern half of the county. In Raritan Township, eight apartments were evacuated as access to the homes was cut off by flood waters. Three township roads were closed as the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded. In Readington Township, the Pleasant Run Brook flooded. It flooded and eroded Pleasant Run Road as well as basements along the roadway. A man was rescued in five feet of water on the roadway. A tributary of the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded River Avenue. Stream flooding also caused erosion along Old York Road. In Tewksbury Township, the Rockaway Creek overflowed. In Hampton Borough, the borough park was flooded. After the Furnace Pond Dam (in Sussex County) was damaged on the 13th, flooding began along the Musconetcong River. But, downstream locations received a lucky break when the river flooding changed the course of the river itself. The river diverted itself into the Tilcon Quarry in Mount Olive Township. The quarry became a 75 acre lake and by holding back part of the discharge prevented worse flooding from occurring downstream. Nevertheless, evacuations took place in Warren and Hunterdon Counties, partly because the river was flooding, but also from fear that the Furnace Pond and Musconetcong Lake dams would completely fail. In Hackettstown (Warren County), East Avenue was flooded by the river and families and the elderly were evacuated from Waterloo Road and East Avenue. The East Avenue Bridge into Washington Township (Morris County) was closed due to flooding through Wednesday morning (the 16th). There were several evacuations also in Allamuchy Township (Warren County). About an additional 300 families were recommended to evacuate in the event of dam failure. Families were evacuated near the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County in Bethlehem Township, Bloomsbury Borough, Hampton Borough and Lebanon Township. In Lebanon Township, the Musconetcong flooded Butler's Park and adjacent roadways. Some sheds and barns were flooded. The Musconetcong River crept into some streets and grassy areas as well as throughout the Musconetcong River Greenway. It crested the night of the 14th. The only river related death occurred on the 15th, when a 58-year-old kayaker leapt out of his kayak about twenty yards upstream from the Finesville Road Bridge. Saturday (the 12th) storm totals included 2.87 inches in Stanton (Hunterdon County), 2.60 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County) and 1.51 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County). On Monday the 14th, around an additional 1.50 inches of rain fell, with the highest amounts in southern Hunterdon County. Storm totals included 2.23 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County),  1.42 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County), 1.38 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County) and 0.60 inches in Phillipsburg (Warren County).",NA,PDC

Doppler Radar Storm total estimates reached around 15 inches along the Sussex/Morris County border.  Two to three inches of rain fell per hour in the strongest storms and caused considerable, widespread and devastating flooding across southeastern Sussex County and western Morris County. Mud and rock slides exacerbated the damage. This was approximately a one in a thousand year event. About 2,700 homes and businesses were flooded. Eight houses were totally destroyed, about one hundred suffered major damage.  About 2,600 persons were evacuated in Morris, Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon Counties, including children at a day camp in Byram Township (Sussex County). In Morris County, three bridges were destroyed, two dams were badly damaged, four others suffered some damage and about two dozen roads were closed or damaged. The torrential rain caused a record rise in Lake Hopatcong and lakeside flooding in Jefferson and Roxbury Townships (Morris County). The record level of Lake Hoptacong led to downstream flooding along the Musconetcong River through Warren and Hunterdon Counties. In Sussex County: three dams were destroyed, six other dams were damaged, three bridges were destroyed, eight others were closed or damaged and three roads were swept away.  Countless others were closed. Newton's water mains were ruptured by the flash flooding cutting off its main water supply. A temporary hookup was made to Sparta's water system. It might be up to four years before the lines will be repaired. Water restrictions were placed in effect for those two communities. In addition, residents in Newton, Ogdensburg, Sparta (all Sussex County) and Jefferson and Roxbury (Morris County) were advised to boil their water before consuming it.  The greatest damage to any business occurred to Compac Corporation in Stanhope (Sussex County) after the Furnace Pond Dam failed on Sunday the 13th. The Musconetcong River crashed into the building and flooded the entire first floor. Throughout the area persons were rescued after their vehicles drove into the water on collapsed roadways. Miraculously no serious injuries occurred. Around an inch of additional rain fell on Monday the 14th. This continued the fear of further mudslides, dam collapses and flooding, especially along the Musconetcong River. The additional rain also caused flooding along the main stem of the Passaic River in Morris County. A state of emergency was declared for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 14th. A federal disaster area declaration was issued by President Clinton for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 16th.  Damage was estimated at 179 million dollars. About 12,000 GPU Energy customers lost power. The only death occurred when a 58-year-old man's kayak overturned on the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County on the 15th and he apparently drowned. **** IN SUSSEX COUNTY ****Sussex County bore the brunt of the storm with about 1,700 homes and businesses damaged. About half of the monetary damage occurred to roads, dams, bridges and public buildings. No place was hit harder than Sparta Township. Devastating flooding occurred near and along the Glen Brook and Wallkill River. The raging Glen Brook carved a canyon in Sparta Glen (a township park), uprooted trees and brought boulders down from Edison and Sparta Mountains. The brook also tore the water mains of Newton's water supply from Morris Lake. The two mains were torn for 1.5 miles. Repairs were expected to take up to four years. The lower section of Glen Road (County Route 620) fell into the Sparta Glen. It continued to collapse through Monday (the 14th). A 50 foot by 50 foot and 20 foot deep hole was created where the road was. Repairs were expected to take one year and damage to Sparta Glen was estimated at 2 million dollars. The torrential rains filled ponds and lakes and caused dam failures.  Both the Edison Pond and Seneca Dams were destroyed. In the latter, the 25 acre lake completely drained leaving behind dead fish. The Sparta and Hawthorne Lake Dams were damaged. Three hundred tons of gravel was used to shore the Fox Trail Lake Dam. One hundred homes were evacuated near the dam.  Mudslides down Sparta and Edison Mountains through the 14th covered County Route 517 (Main Street), the tracks of the New York-Susquehanna and Western Railroad and the Eagle's Nest Wastewater pump station. About 200 persons along Main Street were evacuated through Monday (the 14th) out of fear of further mudslides. Slow service along the railroad was restored that afternoon. The road was totally repaired in early October. In addition to Glen Road and the Glen Road Bridge, the flash flooding totally swept away sections of  Edison Road and Old Forge River Road and totally destroyed the Seneca Lake Bridge. Other bridges were damaged including the Main Street, Station Road, Park Street, Morris Lake and the bridge near Arapaho Trail.  Persons living on Old Forge River Road and Morris Lake Road only access to the outside world was via foot bridges. Temporary bridges were reopened by August 26th. The bridge repair near Arapaho Trail was completed on September 25th. Prior to that repair, it took residents and school buses over 45 minutes to reach the downtown areas of Sparta (normally a 10 minute trip). Most of the home damage occurred along Main Street and Glen Road. Three homes in the township were destroyed, seven were deemed uninhabitable and fifty other were damaged.  In Stanhope Borough, the largest singular loss occurred when the Musconetcong River Dam and the Furnace Pond Dam were damaged. The drainage conduit on the Furnace Pond Dam was eroded to three times its normal size when a large concrete chunk broke away. It increased the outflow along the Musconetcong River. The river rose from five feet to twenty feet. The river normally flows underneath the Compac Corporation's building. But the sudden rise ripped away a bank that normally channeled the flow away from the first floor. Instead it flowed straight into the first floor of the building. The water reached six feet high and shifted large amounts of inventory, pushed 2,000 rolls of paper out of the building  and drenched thousands of dollars of equipment. A forty-two inch diameter tree became stuck within the first floor. About 1,800 feet of the parking lot was ripped away. The structural integrity of the building was intact, but all of the company's machinery was damaged. Damage was expected to be in the millions. Production resumed in mid-September. Flood damage also occurred to the nearby Isolatek International Company, but was not as substantial. A few other businesses in Stanhope and Netcong (Morris County) suffered minor damage. The Kelly Place Bridge was damaged and not reopened until September 4th. The New Jersey State Route 183 bridge was also closed because it was flooded, but it was not damaged. In Ogdensburg Borough, three bridges over the Wallkill River were badly damaged (Corkhill Road, Kennedy Avenue and Bridge Street) and closed. About 200 persons were evacuated. These closings either isolated families (they had to walk across makeshift foot bridges) or forced them to go into the next township to reach their homes. Two were still closed in early October. Two roads were closed because the Wallkill River tore away the asphalt. One of them, the Corkhill Road Tunnel was closed indefinitely. Four homes had water damage up to their second floor. A water main on Corkhill Road was breached. This forced the borough to declare a state of  emergency because of  low water supply. It was repaired on Tuesday (the 15th),In Byram Township, the failure of the Seneca Lake Dam led to the destruction of the Tomahawk Lake Dam and the Tomahawk Trail Bridge (near the Sparta border). The Tomahawk Water Recreation Park was destroyed.  The Lake Drive Bridge near Lake Lackawanna was closed indefinitely. The Kelly Place Bridge was also damaged. Three hundred families in the Brookwood Neighborhood along River Road near the Musconetcong River were evacuated on Monday (the 14th). Hundreds of children were evacuated on Monday from the Jefferson Lake Day Camp because of the unknown integrity of a nearby dam.  In Hardyston Township, About 20 families were evacuated from around Summit Lake. The dams around Summit Lake, Tamarack Lake and Lake Girard were damaged, but remained intact. The Tamarack Lake Dam was aided by 1,000 sandbags. New Jersey State Route 23 was closed in Stockholm. The township estimated property damage at nearly one million dollars.  In Newton Town, a strip mall was submerged. But the largest problem was the loss of its two water mains from Morris Lake. It supplied 80 percent of the town's water. Half of the town lost its water instantaneously. The town set up four 5,000 gallon water tankers to distribute water. Many businesses were closed on Monday the 14th. A temporary connection to Sparta's water supply was completed on Tuesday the 15th. But it was estimated that it will take from 1 to 4 years to re-establish its own water supply at a cost of up to 3 million dollars. In Franklin Borough, about 130 persons were evacuated along the Wallkill River and Franklin Pond. County Route 517 into Sparta Township was closed because of mudslides. Elsewhere in Sussex County, a few roads were closed due to flooding in Frankford Township, Hamburg Borough, Lafayette Township and Wantage Township. About a dozen businesses suffered flood damage in Franklin and Hamburg Boroughs and  Sparta Township. Farms were flooded along the Wallkill River. Saturday's storm totals included 14.11 inches in Sparta, 6.84 inches in Hamburg, 4.33 inches in Stockholm, 2.84 inches in Vernon, 2.47 inches in Wantage, 2.08 inches in Sussex and 1.18 inches in Andover. On Monday the 14th, 1.15 inches fell in Andover and 0.71 inches in Andover.**** IN MORRIS COUNTY ****In Morris County, the unprecedented rainfall caused a record rise on Lake Hoptacong as well as flash flooding across the western part of the county. Flooding along the Rockaway River then pushed downstream toward and beyond the Boonton Reservoir. Flooding also occurred around Lake Shawnee and was exacerbated by damage to its dam. About 1,000 homes and businesses were damaged. Two houses were destroyed, 75 suffered major damage while 727 others suffered minor damage. About two dozen county bridges and roads were damaged. Three bridges were destroyed. Hundreds of roads were closed including the much traveled New Jersey State Route 15. Vehicles drove into flood waters after several roadways collapsed. About 150 persons were rescued from flood waters. About 400 persons were evacuated, mainly from locations near Lake Hopatcong and Lake Shawnee. Damage in the county was estimated at 12 million dollars.The hardest hit municipality in Morris County was Jefferson Township. The heaviest rain in the county fell over this township with Doppler Radar storm total estimates of 15 inches. The township suffered flooding from three fronts: Lake Hopatcong, Lake Shawnee and the Rockaway River and its tributaries. Lake Hopatcong rose nearly twelve feet on Saturday (the 12th) to its highest level in 114 years of record. At 6 a.m. EDT on Sunday (the 13th), the lake was 34 inches above the dam that spills into the Musconetcong River (in Roxbury Township). The previous record was set in 1955. The rise in Lake Hopatcong flooded the basements of lakeside homes. Fish were found in the basements. The lake also lifted boats above fixed docks and eventually pulled them under water. Hundreds of docks and dozens of boats were pulled under water. Other boats sunk. Boat lines were cut in the hopes of stopping boats from sinking. Sections of docks, propane tanks and lawn furniture were floating in the lake. The State Police Marine Bureau  in Great Cove was flooded. After the rain ended, a boating ban was placed in effect to prevent damage to boats by the debris and further lakefront home damage from waves. A swimming ban was also in effect due to goose droppings that streamed into the lake, oil escaping from sunken boats and outflow from nearby septic tanks. A boil drinking water advisory was issued by both Jefferson and Roxbury Townships. The Lake Shawnee Dam was badly damaged. The lake engulfed homes, damaged boats and tore off driveways. Residents were evacuated from around the lake. The loosened ground helped a tree crash onto a house near the lake. The torrential rain caused flash flooding along the Rockaway River and its tributaries. The Dover-Milton Road Bridge and two bridges on Taylor Road between County Route 699 and New Jersey State Route 15 were destroyed. They were reopened by the 28th of August. Bridges on Lower Berkshire Valley Road, Russia Road and Lorettacong Trail were closed due to roadway washouts. Vehicles drove into flood waters. Boulders, tree stumps and tires littered roadways. New Jersey State Route 15 was closed in several locations because of either flooding or rock slides. The worst one occurred toward Interstate 80. The state route was reopened on the 13th by using the shoulder on the south side of the highway. Flooding was so high on Espanong Road that a dog was rescued from a roof. Roads along Weldon Brook were also flooded. Several township dams (Lake Winona, Swannanoa, Hartung and No Name #51) showed signs of erosion and wear, but held. In Roxbury Township, all 160 lakeside (Hopatcong) homes had water encroaching upon the docks. Forty-eight homes had either interior flood or structural damage. Two businesses along the lake were badly damaged. Berkshire Valley Road was closed. In Mount Arlington Borough, flooding near the lake started at 10 a.m. EDT. About 50 homes were evacuated along the lake.  In Mount Olive Township, the worst flooding occurred on Sunday the 13th and Monday the 14th after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged. The rising Musconetcong River changed its course and flooded the Tilcon Quarry. The quarry became a 75 acre lake. Two bridges were closed between the township and Netcong Borough. As a precaution, New Jersey Transit canceled service between Mount Olive Township and Hackettstown on the 14th. The fortunate diversion of the river into the active quarry prevented flood damage from occurring farther downstream in Warren and Hunterdon Counties. It is expected to take several months to dry the Tilcon Quarry. About five homes along the river were evacuated on the 14th. A couple of businesses along the river in Netcong Borough were flooded. In Washington Township, the East Avenue Bridge (over the Musconetcong River) into Hackettstown was closed through the morning of the 15th. Elsewhere, in Rockaway Township, New Jersey State Route 15 was also closed near Mase Mountain as trees, boulders and dirt washed across the roadway. Several families were evacuated after flood waters ripped away a 30 foot chunk of the foundation under Mountain View Manor. There were wet basements throughout the township. Even though the rain was lighter, flooding along the Rockaway River extended downstream from Jefferson Township. In Wharton Borough, the Washington Forge Dam was badly damaged.  The overflow from the dam divided the borough in half. One family along Main Street was rescued and evacuated. Ross Street was damaged. In Dover Township, forty people were evacuated near the Rockaway River. Nine roadways including New Jersey State Route 15 was flooded. Basements were flooded and cars were stuck in flood waters. In Denville Township, five roads were closed on the 13th near the river. Property right along the river was submerged. A canoeist was rescued from the river after it capsized. The Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 13th. It crested at 5.04 feet at midnight on the 14th and was back within bankfull at 2 a.m. EDT on the 14th. The Rockaway River below the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 7 a.m. EDT on the 13th, crested at 6.59 feet at 1230 p.m. EDT on the 13th and was back within bankfull at 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. The Passaic River at Pine Brook reached its 19 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, crested at 19.24 feet at 1245 p.m. EDT on the 15th and was back within bankfull at Midnight EDT on the 17th. Storm totals on the 12th included 8.46 inches in Berkshire Valley, 6.50 inches in Middle Valley, 5.63 inches in West Wharton, 4.20 inches in Milton, 2.56 inches in Boonton, 1.85 inches in Ironia, 1.82 inches in Chatham, 1.53 inches in Marcella and 1.51 inches in Morris Plains. On Monday the 14th, an additional inch to inch and a half of rain fell across the county. Storm totals included 1.68 inches in Marcella, 1.30 inches in Long Valley and 0.90 inches in Chatham. **** IN WARREN AND HUNTERDON COUNTIES ****Warren and Hunterdon Counties suffered flooding from two sides. There was the initial small stream flooding that occurred with the torrential downpours during the afternoon of the 12th. Then there was the subsequent river flooding along the Musconetcong River after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged on the 13th through the 16th. On the afternoon of the 12th, small stream flooding in Warren County was mainly confined to Allamuchy Township. In Hunterdon County, there was more widespread torrential downpours and flooding affected the eastern half of the county. In Raritan Township, eight apartments were evacuated as access to the homes was cut off by flood waters. Three township roads were closed as the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded. In Readington Township, the Pleasant Run Brook flooded. It flooded and eroded Pleasant Run Road as well as basements along the roadway. A man was rescued in five feet of water on the roadway. A tributary of the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded River Avenue. Stream flooding also caused erosion along Old York Road. In Tewksbury Township, the Rockaway Creek overflowed. In Hampton Borough, the borough park was flooded. After the Furnace Pond Dam (in Sussex County) was damaged on the 13th, flooding began along the Musconetcong River. But, downstream locations received a lucky break when the river flooding changed the course of the river itself. The river diverted itself into the Tilcon Quarry in Mount Olive Township. The quarry became a 75 acre lake and by holding back part of the discharge prevented worse flooding from occurring downstream. Nevertheless, evacuations took place in Warren and Hunterdon Counties, partly because the river was flooding, but also from fear that the Furnace Pond and Musconetcong Lake dams would completely fail. In Hackettstown (Warren County), East Avenue was flooded by the river and families and the elderly were evacuated from Waterloo Road and East Avenue. The East Avenue Bridge into Washington Township (Morris County) was closed due to flooding through Wednesday morning (the 16th). There were several evacuations also in Allamuchy Township (Warren County). About an additional 300 families were recommended to evacuate in the event of dam failure. Families were evacuated near the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County in Bethlehem Township, Bloomsbury Borough, Hampton Borough and Lebanon Township. In Lebanon Township, the Musconetcong flooded Butler's Park and adjacent roadways. Some sheds and barns were flooded. The Musconetcong River crept into some streets and grassy areas as well as throughout the Musconetcong River Greenway. It crested the night of the 14th. The only river related death occurred on the 15th, when a 58-year-old kayaker leapt out of his kayak about twenty yards upstream from the Finesville Road Bridge. Saturday (the 12th) storm totals included 2.87 inches in Stanton (Hunterdon County), 2.60 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County) and 1.51 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County). On Monday the 14th, around an additional 1.50 inches of rain fell, with the highest amounts in southern Hunterdon County. Storm totals included 2.23 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County),  1.42 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County), 1.38 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County) and 0.60 inches in Phillipsburg (Warren County).",NA,PDC

Doppler Radar Storm total estimates reached around 15 inches along the Sussex/Morris County border.  Two to three inches of rain fell per hour in the strongest storms and caused considerable, widespread and devastating flooding across southeastern Sussex County and western Morris County. Mud and rock slides exacerbated the damage. This was approximately a one in a thousand year event. About 2,700 homes and businesses were flooded. Eight houses were totally destroyed, about one hundred suffered major damage.  About 2,600 persons were evacuated in Morris, Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon Counties, including children at a day camp in Byram Township (Sussex County). In Morris County, three bridges were destroyed, two dams were badly damaged, four others suffered some damage and about two dozen roads were closed or damaged. The torrential rain caused a record rise in Lake Hopatcong and lakeside flooding in Jefferson and Roxbury Townships (Morris County). The record level of Lake Hoptacong led to downstream flooding along the Musconetcong River through Warren and Hunterdon Counties. In Sussex County: three dams were destroyed, six other dams were damaged, three bridges were destroyed, eight others were closed or damaged and three roads were swept away.  Countless others were closed. Newton's water mains were ruptured by the flash flooding cutting off its main water supply. A temporary hookup was made to Sparta's water system. It might be up to four years before the lines will be repaired. Water restrictions were placed in effect for those two communities. In addition, residents in Newton, Ogdensburg, Sparta (all Sussex County) and Jefferson and Roxbury (Morris County) were advised to boil their water before consuming it.  The greatest damage to any business occurred to Compac Corporation in Stanhope (Sussex County) after the Furnace Pond Dam failed on Sunday the 13th. The Musconetcong River crashed into the building and flooded the entire first floor. Throughout the area persons were rescued after their vehicles drove into the water on collapsed roadways. Miraculously no serious injuries occurred. Around an inch of additional rain fell on Monday the 14th. This continued the fear of further mudslides, dam collapses and flooding, especially along the Musconetcong River. The additional rain also caused flooding along the main stem of the Passaic River in Morris County. A state of emergency was declared for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 14th. A federal disaster area declaration was issued by President Clinton for Morris and Sussex Counties on the 16th.  Damage was estimated at 179 million dollars. About 12,000 GPU Energy customers lost power. The only death occurred when a 58-year-old man's kayak overturned on the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County on the 15th and he apparently drowned. **** IN SUSSEX COUNTY ****Sussex County bore the brunt of the storm with about 1,700 homes and businesses damaged. About half of the monetary damage occurred to roads, dams, bridges and public buildings. No place was hit harder than Sparta Township. Devastating flooding occurred near and along the Glen Brook and Wallkill River. The raging Glen Brook carved a canyon in Sparta Glen (a township park), uprooted trees and brought boulders down from Edison and Sparta Mountains. The brook also tore the water mains of Newton's water supply from Morris Lake. The two mains were torn for 1.5 miles. Repairs were expected to take up to four years. The lower section of Glen Road (County Route 620) fell into the Sparta Glen. It continued to collapse through Monday (the 14th). A 50 foot by 50 foot and 20 foot deep hole was created where the road was. Repairs were expected to take one year and damage to Sparta Glen was estimated at 2 million dollars. The torrential rains filled ponds and lakes and caused dam failures.  Both the Edison Pond and Seneca Dams were destroyed. In the latter, the 25 acre lake completely drained leaving behind dead fish. The Sparta and Hawthorne Lake Dams were damaged. Three hundred tons of gravel was used to shore the Fox Trail Lake Dam. One hundred homes were evacuated near the dam.  Mudslides down Sparta and Edison Mountains through the 14th covered County Route 517 (Main Street), the tracks of the New York-Susquehanna and Western Railroad and the Eagle's Nest Wastewater pump station. About 200 persons along Main Street were evacuated through Monday (the 14th) out of fear of further mudslides. Slow service along the railroad was restored that afternoon. The road was totally repaired in early October. In addition to Glen Road and the Glen Road Bridge, the flash flooding totally swept away sections of  Edison Road and Old Forge River Road and totally destroyed the Seneca Lake Bridge. Other bridges were damaged including the Main Street, Station Road, Park Street, Morris Lake and the bridge near Arapaho Trail.  Persons living on Old Forge River Road and Morris Lake Road only access to the outside world was via foot bridges. Temporary bridges were reopened by August 26th. The bridge repair near Arapaho Trail was completed on September 25th. Prior to that repair, it took residents and school buses over 45 minutes to reach the downtown areas of Sparta (normally a 10 minute trip). Most of the home damage occurred along Main Street and Glen Road. Three homes in the township were destroyed, seven were deemed uninhabitable and fifty other were damaged.

The Kelly Place Bridge was damaged and not reopened until September 4th. The New Jersey State Route 183 bridge was also closed because it was flooded, but it was not damaged. In Ogdensburg Borough, three bridges over the Wallkill River were badly damaged (Corkhill Road, Kennedy Avenue and Bridge Street) and closed. About 200 persons were evacuated. These closings either isolated families (they had to walk across makeshift foot bridges) or forced them to go into the next township to reach their homes. Two were still closed in early October. Two roads were closed because the Wallkill River tore away the asphalt. One of them, the Corkhill Road Tunnel was closed indefinitely. Four homes had water damage up to their second floor. A water main on Corkhill Road was breached. This forced the borough to declare a state of  emergency because of  low water supply. It was repaired on Tuesday (the 15th),In Byram Township, the failure of the Seneca Lake Dam led to the destruction of the Tomahawk Lake Dam and the Tomahawk Trail Bridge (near the Sparta border). The Tomahawk Water Recreation Park was destroyed.  The Lake Drive Bridge near Lake Lackawanna was closed indefinitely. The Kelly Place Bridge was also damaged. Three hundred families in the Brookwood Neighborhood along River Road near the Musconetcong River were evacuated on Monday (the 14th). Hundreds of children were evacuated on Monday from the Jefferson Lake Day Camp because of the unknown integrity of a nearby dam.  In Hardyston Township, About 20 families were evacuated from around Summit Lake. The dams around Summit Lake, Tamarack Lake and Lake Girard were damaged, but remained intact. The Tamarack Lake Dam was aided by 1,000 sandbags. New Jersey State Route 23 was closed in Stockholm. The township estimated property damage at nearly one million dollars.  In Newton Town, a strip mall was submerged. But the largest problem was the loss of its two water mains from Morris Lake. It supplied 80 percent of the town's water. Half of the town lost its water instantaneously. The town set up four 5,000 gallon water tankers to distribute water. Many businesses were closed on Monday the 14th. A temporary connection to Sparta's water supply was completed on Tuesday the 15th. But it was estimated that it will take from 1 to 4 years to re-establish its own water supply at a cost of up to 3 million dollars. In Franklin Borough, about 130 persons were evacuated along the Wallkill River and Franklin Pond. County Route 517 into Sparta Township was closed because of mudslides. Elsewhere in Sussex County, a few roads were closed due to flooding in Frankford Township, Hamburg Borough, Lafayette Township and Wantage Township. About a dozen businesses suffered flood damage in Franklin and Hamburg Boroughs and  Sparta Township. Farms were flooded along the Wallkill River. Saturday's storm totals included 14.11 inches in Sparta, 6.84 inches in Hamburg, 4.33 inches in Stockholm, 2.84 inches in Vernon, 2.47 inches in Wantage, 2.08 inches in Sussex and 1.18 inches in Andover. On Monday the 14th, 1.15 inches fell in Andover and 0.71 inches in Andover.**** IN MORRIS COUNTY ****In Morris County, the unprecedented rainfall caused a record rise on Lake Hoptacong as well as flash flooding across the western part of the county. Flooding along the Rockaway River then pushed downstream toward and beyond the Boonton Reservoir. Flooding also occurred around Lake Shawnee and was exacerbated by damage to its dam. About 1,000 homes and businesses were damaged. Two houses were destroyed, 75 suffered major damage while 727 others suffered minor damage. About two dozen county bridges and roads were damaged. Three bridges were destroyed. Hundreds of roads were closed including the much traveled New Jersey State Route 15. Vehicles drove into flood waters after several roadways collapsed. About 150 persons were rescued from flood waters. About 400 persons were evacuated, mainly from locations near Lake Hopatcong and Lake Shawnee. Damage in the county was estimated at 12 million dollars.The hardest hit municipality in Morris County was Jefferson Township. The heaviest rain in the county fell over this township with Doppler Radar storm total estimates of 15 inches. The township suffered flooding from three fronts: Lake Hopatcong, Lake Shawnee and the Rockaway River and its tributaries. Lake Hopatcong rose nearly twelve feet on Saturday (the 12th) to its highest level in 114 years of record. At 6 a.m. EDT on Sunday (the 13th), the lake was 34 inches above the dam that spills into the Musconetcong River (in Roxbury Township). The previous record was set in 1955. The rise in Lake Hopatcong flooded the basements of lakeside homes. Fish were found in the basements. The lake also lifted boats above fixed docks and eventually pulled them under water. Hundreds of docks and dozens of boats were pulled under water. Other boats sunk. Boat lines were cut in the hopes of stopping boats from sinking. Sections of docks, propane tanks and lawn furniture were floating in the lake. The State Police Marine Bureau  in Great Cove was flooded. After the rain ended, a boating ban was placed in effect to prevent damage to boats by the debris and further lakefront home damage from waves. A swimming ban was also in effect due to goose droppings that streamed into the lake, oil escaping from sunken boats and outflow from nearby septic tanks. A boil drinking water advisory was issued by both Jefferson and Roxbury Townships. The Lake Shawnee Dam was badly damaged. The lake engulfed homes, damaged boats and tore off driveways. Residents were evacuated from around the lake. The loosened ground helped a tree crash onto a house near the lake. The torrential rain caused flash flooding along the Rockaway River and its tributaries. The Dover-Milton Road Bridge and two bridges on Taylor Road between County Route 699 and New Jersey State Route 15 were destroyed. They were reopened by the 28th of August. Bridges on Lower Berkshire Valley Road, Russia Road and Lorettacong Trail were closed due to roadway washouts. Vehicles drove into flood waters. Boulders, tree stumps and tires littered roadways. New Jersey State Route 15 was closed in several locations because of either flooding or rock slides. The worst one occurred toward Interstate 80. The state route was reopened on the 13th by using the shoulder on the south side of the highway. Flooding was so high on Espanong Road that a dog was rescued from a roof. Roads along Weldon Brook were also flooded. Several township dams (Lake Winona, Swannanoa, Hartung and No Name #51) showed signs of erosion and wear, but held. In Roxbury Township, all 160 lakeside (Hopatcong) homes had water encroaching upon the docks. Forty-eight homes had either interior flood or structural damage. Two businesses along the lake were badly damaged. Berkshire Valley Road was closed. In Mount Arlington Borough, flooding near the lake started at 10 a.m. EDT. About 50 homes were evacuated along the lake.  In Mount Olive Township, the worst flooding occurred on Sunday the 13th and Monday the 14th after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged. The rising Musconetcong River changed its course and flooded the Tilcon Quarry. The quarry became a 75 acre lake. Two bridges were closed between the township and Netcong Borough. As a precaution, New Jersey Transit canceled service between Mount Olive Township and Hackettstown on the 14th. The fortunate diversion of the river into the active quarry prevented flood damage from occurring farther downstream in Warren and Hunterdon Counties. It is expected to take several months to dry the Tilcon Quarry. About five homes along the river were evacuated on the 14th. A couple of businesses along the river in Netcong Borough were flooded. In Washington Township, the East Avenue Bridge (over the Musconetcong River) into Hackettstown was closed through the morning of the 15th. Elsewhere, in Rockaway Township, New Jersey State Route 15 was also closed near Mase Mountain as trees, boulders and dirt washed across the roadway. Several families were evacuated after flood waters ripped away a 30 foot chunk of the foundation under Mountain View Manor. There were wet basements throughout the township. Even though the rain was lighter, flooding along the Rockaway River extended downstream from Jefferson Township. In Wharton Borough, the Washington Forge Dam was badly damaged.  The overflow from the dam divided the borough in half. One family along Main Street was rescued and evacuated. Ross Street was damaged. In Dover Township, forty people were evacuated near the Rockaway River. Nine roadways including New Jersey State Route 15 was flooded. Basements were flooded and cars were stuck in flood waters. In Denville Township, five roads were closed on the 13th near the river. Property right along the river was submerged. A canoeist was rescued from the river after it capsized. The Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 13th. It crested at 5.04 feet at midnight on the 14th and was back within bankfull at 2 a.m. EDT on the 14th. The Rockaway River below the Boonton Reservoir reached its 5 foot flood stage at 7 a.m. EDT on the 13th, crested at 6.59 feet at 1230 p.m. EDT on the 13th and was back within bankfull at 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. The Passaic River at Pine Brook reached its 19 foot flood stage at 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, crested at 19.24 feet at 1245 p.m. EDT on the 15th and was back within bankfull at Midnight EDT on the 17th. Storm totals on the 12th included 8.46 inches in Berkshire Valley, 6.50 inches in Middle Valley, 5.63 inches in West Wharton, 4.20 inches in Milton, 2.56 inches in Boonton, 1.85 inches in Ironia, 1.82 inches in Chatham, 1.53 inches in Marcella and 1.51 inches in Morris Plains. On Monday the 14th, an additional inch to inch and a half of rain fell across the county. Storm totals included 1.68 inches in Marcella, 1.30 inches in Long Valley and 0.90 inches in Chatham. **** IN WARREN AND HUNTERDON COUNTIES ****Warren and Hunterdon Counties suffered flooding from two sides. There was the initial small stream flooding that occurred with the torrential downpours during the afternoon of the 12th. Then there was the subsequent river flooding along the Musconetcong River after the Furnace Pond Dam was damaged on the 13th through the 16th. On the afternoon of the 12th, small stream flooding in Warren County was mainly confined to Allamuchy Township. In Hunterdon County, there was more widespread torrential downpours and flooding affected the eastern half of the county. In Raritan Township, eight apartments were evacuated as access to the homes was cut off by flood waters. Three township roads were closed as the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded. In Readington Township, the Pleasant Run Brook flooded. It flooded and eroded Pleasant Run Road as well as basements along the roadway. A man was rescued in five feet of water on the roadway. A tributary of the South Branch of the Raritan River flooded River Avenue. Stream flooding also caused erosion along Old York Road. In Tewksbury Township, the Rockaway Creek overflowed. In Hampton Borough, the borough park was flooded. After the Furnace Pond Dam (in Sussex County) was damaged on the 13th, flooding began along the Musconetcong River. But, downstream locations received a lucky break when the river flooding changed the course of the river itself. The river diverted itself into the Tilcon Quarry in Mount Olive Township. The quarry became a 75 acre lake and by holding back part of the discharge prevented worse flooding from occurring downstream. Nevertheless, evacuations took place in Warren and Hunterdon Counties, partly because the river was flooding, but also from fear that the Furnace Pond and Musconetcong Lake dams would completely fail. In Hackettstown (Warren County), East Avenue was flooded by the river and families and the elderly were evacuated from Waterloo Road and East Avenue. The East Avenue Bridge into Washington Township (Morris County) was closed due to flooding through Wednesday morning (the 16th). There were several evacuations also in Allamuchy Township (Warren County). About an additional 300 families were recommended to evacuate in the event of dam failure. Families were evacuated near the Musconetcong River in Hunterdon County in Bethlehem Township, Bloomsbury Borough, Hampton Borough and Lebanon Township. In Lebanon Township, the Musconetcong flooded Butler's Park and adjacent roadways. Some sheds and barns were flooded. The Musconetcong River crept into some streets and grassy areas as well as throughout the Musconetcong River Greenway. It crested the night of the 14th. The only river related death occurred on the 15th, when a 58-year-old kayaker leapt out of his kayak about twenty yards upstream from the Finesville Road Bridge. Saturday (the 12th) storm totals included 2.87 inches in Stanton (Hunterdon County), 2.60 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County) and 1.51 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County). On Monday the 14th, around an additional 1.50 inches of rain fell, with the highest amounts in southern Hunterdon County. Storm totals included 2.23 inches in Wertsville (Hunterdon County),  1.42 inches in Flemington (Hunterdon County), 1.38 inches in Hackettstown (Warren County) and 0.60 inches in Phillipsburg (Warren County).",NA,PDC

This continued for several hours and resulted in widespread storm totals exceeding 6 inches across most of  the Rancocas Creek Basin. A storm total of 13.20 inches was reported in Tabernacle within a 12 hour period and represented a once in a thousand year storm. The excessive rain caused record breaking flash flooding along nearly every stream in the Rancocas Basin and led to the failure or damage of 51 dams in Burlington County. Widespread poor drainage flooding also occurred. The combination of the dam failure and stream flooding led to the evacuation of 760 residents,  the destruction of seven homes in Lumberton and Southampton Townships, major flood damage to around 200 homes,  flood damage to about 1,000 homes, countless water rescues from vehicles and homes, the closing of 25 major roads including the New Jersey Turnpike, New Jersey State Routes 70 and 73, the contamination of drinking water and failure of sewage systems and the serious damage or destruction of fourteen bridges.  Hardest hit municipalities included Lumberton, Medford, Medford Lakes, Mount Laurel, Pemberton and Southampton all of whom declared states of emergency. The Trenton-Camden High Speed Rail Line suspended service because of flooding along the main stem of the Rancocas Creek. On Friday July 16th, President George W. Bush declared Burlington and neighboring Camden Counties disaster areas. This cleared the way for government grants and low interest loans. Agricultural damage was expected to be in the millions, especially to the cranberry bogs where many retention walls and earthen roads were damaged. Property damage was estimated at fifty million dollars. In spite of all of the record flooding and water rescues, no serious injuries were reported.  Rain, heavy at times, fell throughout most of the morning and afternoon on the 12th, but it intensified further late in the afternoon. At the South Jersey Regional Airport in Lumberton New Jersey, torrential downpours began at 507 p.m. EDT and continued until the 945 p.m. EDT observation. During that four hour period 4.45 inches of rain fell. This airport was located along the western edge of the heaviest rain. An automated gage in New Lisbon recorded 5.19 inches of rain within one hour between 715 p.m. and 815 p.m. EDT. While flooding was already occurring, conditions worsened quickly at around 930 p.m. EDT when the Squaw Lake Dam at Camp Ockanickon failed (Medford). This started a domino effect as the Lake Stockwell Dam (Medford) failed, then the Papoose Dam (Medford), the Upper Aetna Lake Dam (Medford Lakes), the Lower Aetna Lake Dam (Medford Lakes) and the Birchwood Lake Dam (Medford) all within 90 minutes. The dam failure exacerbated the ongoing flooding along Haynes Creek and the Southwest Branch of the Rancocas Creek. Downtown Lumberton Township which is just downstream from the confluence of the Southwest and South Branches of the Rancocas Creek was one of the hardest hit areas. In all 44 dams in the county either failed or were damaged. This included eight significant hazard dams that failed mainly in Medford and Medford Lakes. The lakes behind eight damaged dams were ordered lowered for safety reasons. Most of the dams were privately owned. Debris from the lakes was carried as far as one mile downstream as docks, canoes and furniture were swept away. Canoes were found wrapped around trees.  About 760 people were evacuated from Lumberton, Medford, Medford Lakes, Mount Laurel, Pemberton and Southampton to 10 shelters opened throughout the county. The main shelter at Lenape Regional High School remained opened until the 16th. Two hundred people were still displaced from their homes on the 19th and seventy-five were still displaced on the 27th. Twenty-five main roads were closed during the evening of the 12th. On the next day (13th), fifteen major roadways remained closed including New Jersey State Route 70 in Southampton Township because of a washed away bridge. Nine of the roads were still underwater.  One dozen roads were still closed on the 16th. New Jersey State Route 70 was reopened with a temporary bridge on the 19th. Burlington County Route 541 through downtown Lumberton was not reopened until the 30th. Four golf courses were damaged: Golden Pheasant, Medford Lakes, Medford Village and Ramblewood. Mail deliveries were delayed in Medford and Southampton.  In southern Burlington County, the flow along the Wading and Batsto Rivers was too dangerous to allow kayaking, canoeing and swimming. Clearance under some bridges was less than one foot. Flooding also closed the historic Batsto Village. A mosquito invasion was feared because of all the additional standing water. In Lumberton Township, about 100 homes and businesses were evacuated along the downtown area (Landing Street and Burlington County Route 541 - Main Street). Landing and Main Streets were under six feet of water from the South Branch of the Rancocas Creek. Burlington County Route 541 remained closed through the 30th as residents were not allowed back to their homes for as long as one week because officials feared electrocution and homes had contaminated water. The township's sewage pump station was underwater during the height of the storm. All the downtown homes were inspected before residents were allowed to return and two were razed because of foundation problems.  In Medford Lakes Village, Beach Drive between Lower and Upper Aetna Lakes was destroyed. Lenape Trail near Burlington County Route 541 was washed away. Numerous vehicles were stranded on the road. About a dozen people were rescued from roof tops of vehicles. The village's wastewater treatment plant shut down after a sixty foot long pipe ruptured. Raw sewage from septic systems contaminated the water supply. Residents were asked to not limit water disposal and drink bottled water or boil the tap water before using it. The sewage plant was back on line on the 14th. The Trading Post Way small business district near the base of Lower Aetna Lake was badly damaged. Two homes and two businesses in the village were declared uninhabitable. Even the firehouse was not safe as it was flooded and several of the trucks were damaged.  Repairs to the three damaged dams (Lower Aetna, Upper Aetna and Quoque) was expected to cost 7.5 million dollars.In Medford Township, about 200 people were evacuated mainly near the Timber Lake Dam. As a precaution, the lake was drained. Jackson Road was damaged and closed at the base of the failed Birchwood Lake Dam. Flooding along the Southwest Branch of the Rancocas Creek cut the town in half. Many homes had five feet of water in their basements. Farther upstream, a driver who drove into a flooded New Freedom Road was rescued from the roof of one home. Damaged in the township was estimated at between six and eight million dollars. In Southampton Township, flooding along the South Branch of the Rancocas Creek inundated the Vincentown area. About 150 people were evacuated from this area when flood waters toppled two tanks of petroleum and propane from Allen's Oil and Propane Company.  A tractor-trailer and three smaller trucks were also submerged. The Coast Guard was called upon to secure the tanks. Homes along Main and Mill Street were evacuated after as much as five feet of water entered them. The water was up to the second floor of a couple of homes. Three homes were declared uninhabitable. U.S. Route 206 was closed for two days after an embankment washed away. Hilliards Road Bridge was closed and expected to be closed for a while after the South Branch of the Rancocas Creek swept it away. The damaging of the Friendship Creek dam led to the destruction of a New Jersey State Route 70 Bridge. This heavily traveled road to the New Jersey Shore was not reopened with a temporary bridge until Monday the 19th. Repairs on this one bridge alone were expected to cost three million dollars. In Mount Laurel Township, flooding was centered around the North Branch of the Pennsauken Creek in the Ramblewood and Countryside sections of the township. About 200 people were evacuated centered around Haines Court and Saint Andres Drive. About 500 homes were flooded, two homes suffered structural damage. Two fire trucks were damaged after they became stuck in rising flood waters on Saint Andrews Drive. About 30 acres of Ramblewood Country Club was under water and the White Course was badly damaged. Parker Creek also flooded in the township and forced the closure of a couple of roads.  In Pemberton Township, about 100 people were evacuated after fear that the Oregon Dam on Jefferson Lake would fail along the Bisphams Mill Creek. The evacuation was lifted on the 15th. Both Magnolia and Birmingham Roads were closed. In Evesham Township, many homes flooded near Union Mill Lake. Two of the three wastewater plants in the township were overtaxed and dumped raw sewage into branches of the Pennsauken and Rancocas Creeks. Flooding at the Elmwood Drive water plant submerged well number six under three feet of storm water compromised the township's drinking water. The water was deemed safe on the 14th. In Maple Shade Township, New Jersey State Route 73 was closed into the 14th. This forced the closure of Interchange 4 on the New Jersey Turnpike. About 22 units of the Stoney Run Apartments were flooded by the North Branch of the Pennsauken Creek. In Hainesport Township, a 55-year-old man was rescued from the South Branch of the Rancocas Creek after a watercraft he was within tipped. A couple of roads were closed around Masons Creek. In Tabernacle Township, most of the damage occurred to the crops including the cranberries and peaches.  The North Branch of the Rancocas Creek at Pemberton was above its 2.7 foot flood stage from 115 a.m. EDT on the 13th through 429 p.m. EDT on the 16th. It crested at 4.20 feet at 300 a.m. EDT on the 14th. It was the second highest crest ever for the creek only barely surpassed (4.23 feet) on August 21, 1939.  The South Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Vincentown crested at a record breaking 12.34 feet at 815 a.m. EDT on the 13th, 4.36 feet higher than the previous record in August 28, 1971. The McDonalds Branch in Lebanon State Forest tied its record crest of 2.33 feet. The Greenwood Branch at New Lisbon had a record breaking crest of 8.91 feet at 1130 p.m. EDT on the 13th. Specific storm totals included 13.20 inches in Tabernacle, 11.23 inches in New Lisbon, 10.71 inches also in New Lisbon, 7.50 inches in Lumberton, 7.26 inches in Medford, 6.39 inches in Mount Laurel,  6.17 inches at the McGuire Air Force Base, 5.80 inches in Mount Holly, 4.44 inches in Wrightstown, 4.21 inches in Westampton and 3.90 inches in Willingboro.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

Along tidal sections of the Delaware River, Big Timber Creek flooded along the Gloucester and Camden County lines and about 300 homes in Burlington City (Burlington County) had flooded basements.   ||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.

The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012.

In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.

Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid. The declaration was later extended throughout the state.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 75 mph at Cape May Ferry Terminal (Cape May County), 69 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County), 69 mph in Tuckerton (Ocean County), 68 mph in Cape May Harbor (Cape May County), 66 mph at the Atlantic City Marina (Atlantic County), 66 mph in Ocean City (Cape May County), 65 mph in Point Pleasant (Ocean County), 58 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), 58 mph in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 58 mph in Brick (Ocean County), 57 mph in Keansburg (Monmouth County), 55 mph in Barnegat Light (Ocean County), 55 mph at Lakehurst NAS (Ocean County), 55 mph at Point Point (Atlantic County), 55 mph in Seaside Heights (Ocean County), 53 mph at Wildwood (Cape May County), 52 mph in Belmar (Monmouth County), 52 mph in Bivalve (Cumberland County), 52 mph in Trenton (Mercer County), 51 mph at Ft Dix-Wrightstown (Burlington County), 50 mph in Wantage (Sussex County), 47 mph in Mount Holly (Burlington County) and 42 mph in Somerville (Somerset County).||Peak storm tides included 9.75 feet above mean lower low water in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County).

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey.

The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.

Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid. The declaration was later extended throughout the state.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 75 mph at Cape May Ferry Terminal (Cape May County), 69 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County), 69 mph in Tuckerton (Ocean County), 68 mph in Cape May Harbor (Cape May County), 66 mph at the Atlantic City Marina (Atlantic County), 66 mph in Ocean City (Cape May County), 65 mph in Point Pleasant (Ocean County), 58 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), 58 mph in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 58 mph in Brick (Ocean County), 57 mph in Keansburg (Monmouth County), 55 mph in Barnegat Light (Ocean County), 55 mph at Lakehurst NAS (Ocean County), 55 mph at Point Point (Atlantic County), 55 mph in Seaside Heights (Ocean County), 53 mph at Wildwood (Cape May County), 52 mph in Belmar (Monmouth County), 52 mph in Bivalve (Cumberland County), 52 mph in Trenton (Mercer County), 51 mph at Ft Dix-Wrightstown (Burlington County), 50 mph in Wantage (Sussex County), 47 mph in Mount Holly (Burlington County) and 42 mph in Somerville (Somerset County).||Peak storm tides included 9.75 feet above mean lower low water in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County).

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th.

The high tide reached 6.30 feet above mean lower low water at Atlantic City (Atlantic County). Minor tidal flooding starts at 6.00 feet above mean lower low water. The high tides reached 7.16 feet above mean lower low water at Cape May (Cape May County) and 6.98 feet above mean lower low water at Sandy Hook (Monmouth County). Minor tidal flooding starts at 6.70 feet above mean lower low water.
